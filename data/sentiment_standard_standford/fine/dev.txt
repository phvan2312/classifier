__label__positive	For anyone unfamiliar with pentacostal practices in general and theatrical phenomenon of Hell Houses in particular , it's an eye-opener .
__label__negative	For close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one .
__label__negative	For each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike Tara Reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout .
__label__very_positive	For movie lovers as well as opera lovers , Tosca is a real treat .
__label__negative	For starters , the story is just too slim .
__label__positive	For the first time in years , De Niro digs deep emotionally , perhaps because he's been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars .
__label__very_positive	For the most part , director Anne-Sophie Birot's first feature is a sensitive , extraordinarily well-acted drama .
__label__very_positive	For the most part , it's a work of incendiary genius , steering clear of knee-jerk reactions and quick solutions .
__label__positive	For the most part Stevens glides through on some solid performances and witty dialogue .
__label__positive	For this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- Chelsea Walls deserves a medal .
__label__negative	Forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending .
__label__neutral	Forgettable horror -- more gory than psychological -- with a highly satisfying quotient of Friday-night excitement and Milla power .
__label__positive	Fresnadillo's dark and jolting images have a way of plying into your subconscious like the nightmare you had a week ago that won't go away .
__label__negative	From the opening scenes , it's clear that All About the Benjamins is a totally formulaic movie .
__label__neutral	Full of witless jokes , dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios , and saddled with a general air of misogyny
__label__positive	Fun , flip and terribly hip bit of cinematic entertainment .
__label__positive	Funny but perilously slight .
__label__positive	Further proof that the epicenter of cool , beautiful , thought-provoking foreign cinema is smack-dab in the middle of Dubya's Axis of Evil .
__label__positive	Generally , Clockstoppers will fulfill your wildest fantasies about being a different kind of time traveler , while happily killing 94 minutes .
__label__neutral	Generally provides its target audience of youngsters enough stimulating eye and ear candy to make its moral medicine go down .
__label__very_negative	Given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing Soderbergh has ever done .
__label__positive	Gives you the steady pulse of life in a beautiful city viewed through the eyes of a character who , in spite of tragic loss and increasing decrepitude , knows in his bones that he is one of the luckiest men alive .
__label__positive	Good car chases , great fight scenes , and a distinctive blend of European , American and Asian influences .
__label__positive	Good film , but very glum .
__label__positive	Good old-fashioned slash-and-hack is back !
__label__very_negative	Green might want to hang onto that ski mask , as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project .
__label__very_positive	Griffiths proves she's that rare luminary who continually raises the standard of her profession .
__label__neutral	Half Submarine flick , Half Ghost Story , All in one criminally neglected film
__label__positive	Hardly a masterpiece , but it introduces viewers to a good charitable enterprise and some interesting real people .
__label__neutral	Harland Williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment .
__label__positive	Harris commands the screen , using his frailty to suggest the ravages of a life of corruption and ruthlessness .
__label__positive	Harrison's Flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all .
__label__neutral	Has a long and clunky ending ... which forces the audience to fidget through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes montage to break the audience's awkward silence
__label__positive	Has a lot of the virtues of Eastwood at his best .
__label__very_negative	Has all the depth of a wading pool .
__label__very_positive	Having had the good sense to cast actors who are , generally speaking , adored by the movie-going public , Khouri then gets terrific performances from them all .
__label__very_negative	Here's yet another studio horror franchise mucking up its storyline with glitches casual fans could correct in their sleep .
__label__neutral	Hey Arnold !
__label__neutral	Hey Arnold !
__label__positive	Highbrow self-appointed guardians of culture need not apply , but those who loved Cool as Ice have at last found a worthy follow-up .
__label__positive	Hilariously inept and ridiculous .
__label__negative	His comedy premises are often hackneyed or just plain crude , calculated to provoke shocked laughter , without following up on a deeper level .
__label__positive	His healthy sense of satire is light and fun ...
__label__very_negative	His last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it .
__label__neutral	Historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit .
__label__negative	Hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole ' miss in the way of story .
__label__negative	Holden Caulfield did it better .
__label__very_positive	Holm ... embodies the character with an effortlessly regal charisma .
__label__neutral	Holy mad maniac in a mask , Splat-Man !
__label__negative	However it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust .
__label__neutral	Huppert's superbly controlled display of murderous vulnerability ensures that malice has a very human face .
__label__positive	Huston nails both the glad-handing and the choking sense of hollow despair .
__label__negative	I'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here .
__label__negative	I'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film .
__label__negative	I'm just too bored to care .
__label__neutral	I'm sure if you're a Hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself ... Me , I didn't care for it .
__label__negative	I've always dreamed of attending Cannes , but after seeing this film , it's not that big a deal .
__label__negative	I am sorry that I was unable to get the full brunt of the comedy .
__label__neutral	I can't quite recommend it -- it's too patched together -- but I almost can ; it's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it .
__label__neutral	I can't say that I liked Homeboy ; it'd be more accurate to say that I found it intriguing , bizarre , Dogma-like in spots - and quite truthful , in its way .
__label__negative	I can take infantile humor ... but this is the sort of infantile that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer's diapers .
__label__negative	I don't mind having my heartstrings pulled , but don't treat me like a fool .
__label__very_negative	I don't think I laughed out loud once .
__label__neutral	I felt sad for Lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by Rohmer , for example .
__label__very_negative	I got a headache watching this meaningless downer .
__label__very_negative	I had to look away - this was god awful .
__label__neutral	I have no way of knowing exactly how much is exaggeration , but I've got a creepy feeling that the film is closer to the mark than I want to believe .
__label__very_positive	I just loved every minute of this film .
__label__neutral	I still can't relate to Stuart : He's a mouse , for cryin ' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough .
__label__negative	I sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie doesn't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand .
__label__negative	I thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as I slogged my way through Clockstoppers .
__label__neutral	If I had been thinking about the visual medium , they would have been doing something wrong .
__label__very_positive	If Steven Soderbergh's ` Solaris ' is a failure it is a glorious failure .
__label__neutral	If The Count of Monte Cristo doesn't transform Caviezel into a movie star , then the game is even more rigged than it was two centuries ago .
__label__negative	If director Michael Dowse only superficially understands his characters , he doesn't hold them in contempt .
__label__neutral	If it's seldom boring , well , it's also rarely coherent .
__label__negative	If looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , don't settle for this Imposter .
__label__neutral	If only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con .
__label__very_negative	If the first Men in Black was money , the second is small change .
__label__negative	If the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of ` there but for the grace of God , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world .
__label__very_negative	If there's one thing this world needs less of , it's movies about college that are written and directed by people who couldn't pass an entrance exam .
__label__neutral	If this disposable tissue has one wild card , it's John Turturro , who's simply fab as a Spanish butler with a foot fetish .
__label__neutral	If this story must be told and retold -- and indeed it must -- then The Grey Zone is to be lauded for finding a new and ingenious angle .
__label__neutral	If you're a WWF fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in A.I. , you'll probably like Rollerball .
__label__positive	If you're hard up for raunchy college humor , this is your ticket right here .
__label__neutral	If you're in the mood for a Bollywood film , here's one for you .
__label__negative	If you've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what Sex With Strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever .
__label__neutral	If you've ever wondered what an ending without the input of studio executives or test audiences would look like , here it is .
__label__negative	If you believe any of this , I can make you a real deal on leftover Enron stock that will double in value a week from Friday .
__label__positive	If you can stomach the rough content , it's worth checking out for the performances alone .
__label__very_positive	If you dig on David Mamet's mind tricks ... rent this movie and enjoy !
__label__very_positive	If you enjoy more thoughtful comedies with interesting conflicted characters ; this one is for you .
__label__positive	If your taste runs to ` difficult ' films you absolutely can't miss it .
__label__positive	Immersing us in the endlessly inventive , fiercely competitive world of hip-hop DJs , the project is sensational and revelatory , even if scratching makes you itch .
__label__negative	Impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie doesn't quite fly .
__label__very_positive	In a way , the film feels like a breath of fresh air , but only to those that allow it in .
__label__negative	In all , this is a watchable movie that's not quite the memorable experience it might have been .
__label__negative	In an effort , I suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy .
__label__very_negative	In exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if I'd been sitting naked on an igloo , Formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey .
__label__negative	In execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , Killers From Space .
__label__neutral	In his first stab at the form , Jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically .
__label__very_negative	In its best moments , resembles a bad high school production of Grease , without benefit of song .
__label__neutral	In spite of Good Housekeeping's unsavory characters and WWF mentality , this white trash War of the Roses is a surprisingly engaging film .
__label__very_negative	In the end , the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director Joe Carnahan .
__label__negative	In the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , Chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest .
__label__negative	Indifferently implausible popcorn programmer of a movie .
__label__positive	Inside the film's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out , but it's not that , it's the tension that keeps you in your seat .
__label__very_positive	Instead , he shows them the respect they are due .
__label__positive	Instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western , it's an unpretentious , sociologically pointed slice of life .
__label__very_negative	Instead of hiding Pinocchio from critics , Miramax should have hidden it from everyone .
__label__positive	Intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story's least interesting subject .
__label__very_negative	Involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters .
__label__negative	Irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater .
__label__negative	Is the time really ripe for a warmed-over James Bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ?
__label__neutral	Is this love or is it masochism ?
__label__very_negative	It's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel .
__label__positive	It's a beautiful madness .
__label__negative	It's a bit disappointing that it only manages to be decent instead of dead brilliant .
__label__negative	It's a buggy drag .
__label__very_positive	It's a charming and often affecting journey .
__label__neutral	It's a coming-of-age story we've all seen bits of in other films -- but it's rarely been told with such affecting grace and cultural specificity .
__label__negative	It's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job .
__label__neutral	It's a feature-length adaptation of one of those `` Can This Marriage Be Saved ? ''
__label__negative	It's a grab bag of genres that don't add up to a whole lot of sense .
__label__positive	It's a lovely film with lovely performances by Buy and Accorsi .
__label__positive	It's a much more emotional journey than what Shyamalan has given us in his past two movies , and Gibson , stepping in for Bruce Willis , is the perfect actor to take us on the trip .
__label__very_positive	It's a remarkably solid and subtly satirical tour de force .
__label__neutral	It's a scathing portrayal .
__label__positive	It's a scattershot affair , but when it hits its mark it's brilliant .
__label__positive	It's a stunning lyrical work of considerable force and truth .
__label__neutral	It's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center .
__label__positive	It's a work by an artist so in control of both his medium and his message that he can improvise like a jazzman .
__label__positive	It's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think .
__label__very_positive	It's also , clearly , great fun .
__label__positive	It's an offbeat treat that pokes fun at the democratic exercise while also examining its significance for those who take part .
__label__negative	It's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue .
__label__negative	It's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that's often written off as indie film naturalism .
__label__very_negative	It's as if you're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker .
__label__neutral	It's basically an overlong episode of Tales from the Crypt .
__label__negative	It's clear the filmmakers weren't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination .
__label__very_negative	It's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role .
__label__very_negative	It's dumb , but more importantly , it's just not scary .
__label__very_negative	It's everything you don't go to the movies for .
__label__positive	It's fascinating to see how Bettany and McDowell play off each other .
__label__positive	It's fun lite .
__label__positive	It's great escapist fun that recreates a place and time that will never happen again .
__label__negative	It's hampered by a Lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth .
__label__positive	It's hard to imagine Alan Arkin being better than he is in this performance .
__label__neutral	It's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong .
__label__negative	It's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and Shiner , starring Michael Caine as an aging British boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that .
__label__negative	It's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it's about as exciting as a sunburn .
__label__negative	It's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface .
__label__negative	It's just filler .
__label__very_negative	It's like watching a nightmare made flesh .
__label__positive	It's made with deftly unsettling genre flair .
__label__neutral	It's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes .
__label__negative	It's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it doesn't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks .
__label__negative	It's not that Kung Pow isn't funny some of the time -- it just isn't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all Oedekerk's impish augmentation .
__label__negative	It's not the ultimate Depression-era gangster movie .
__label__neutral	It's not without its pleasures , but I'll stick with The Tune .
__label__negative	It's of the quality of a lesser Harrison Ford movie - Six Days , Seven Nights , maybe , or that dreadful Sabrina remake .
__label__positive	It's one heck of a character study -- not of Hearst or Davies but of the unique relationship between them .
__label__positive	It's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible .
__label__very_negative	It's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions .
__label__negative	It's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up .
__label__very_positive	It's refreshing to see a girl-power movie that doesn't feel it has to prove anything .
__label__very_negative	It's slow -- very , very slow .
__label__positive	It's so good that its relentless , polished wit can withstand not only inept school productions , but even Oliver Parker's movie adaptation .
__label__neutral	It's so good that you can practically see the Hollywood ` suits ' trying to put together the cast and filmmaking team for the all-too - inevitable American remake .
__label__negative	It's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just can't get no satisfaction .
__label__negative	It's somewhat clumsy and too lethargically paced -- but its story about a mysterious creature with psychic abilities offers a solid build-up , a terrific climax , and some nice chills along the way .
__label__neutral	It's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show .
__label__very_positive	It's the chemistry between the women and the droll scene-stealing wit and wolfish pessimism of Anna Chancellor that makes this `` Two Weddings and a Funeral '' fun .
__label__neutral	It's the perfect kind of film to see when you don't want to use your brain .
__label__negative	It's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one .
__label__negative	It's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic .
__label__neutral	It's unnerving to see Recoing's bizzarre reaction to his unemployment .
__label__positive	It's worth seeing just on the basis of the wisdom , and at times , the startling optimism , of the children .
__label__positive	It all adds up to good fun .
__label__very_negative	It all drags on so interminably it's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time .
__label__very_negative	It all feels like a Monty Python sketch gone horribly wrong .
__label__negative	It appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen .
__label__neutral	It believes it's revealing some great human truths , when , in reality , it's churning ground that has long passed the point of being fertile .
__label__negative	It can't decide if it wants to be a mystery\/thriller , a romance or a comedy .
__label__very_negative	It can not be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull .
__label__very_positive	It confirms Fincher's status as a film maker who artfully bends technical know-how to the service of psychological insight .
__label__neutral	It conveys a simple message in a visual style that is willfully overwrought .
__label__positive	It deserves to be seen by anyone with even a passing interest in the events shaping the world beyond their own horizons .
__label__very_negative	It doesn't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor ... it's just plain bored .
__label__negative	It does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they're being streamed over a 28K modem .
__label__very_negative	It feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes .
__label__positive	It gets onto the screen just about as much of the novella as one could reasonably expect , and is engrossing and moving in its own right .
__label__negative	It has all the excitement of eating oatmeal .
__label__positive	It has charm to spare , and unlike many romantic comedies , it does not alienate either gender in the audience .
__label__negative	It has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death .
__label__neutral	It has the ability to offend and put off everyone , but it holds you with its outrageousness .
__label__positive	It has the charm of the original American road movies , feasting on the gorgeous , ramshackle landscape of the filmmaker's motherland .
__label__very_positive	It haunts , horrifies , startles and fascinates ; it is impossible to look away .
__label__positive	It haunts you , you can't forget it , you admire its conception and are able to resolve some of the confusions you had while watching it .
__label__very_positive	It inspires a continuing and deeply satisfying awareness of the best movies as monumental ` picture shows . '
__label__very_positive	It is amusing , and that's all it needs to be .
__label__positive	It is great summer fun to watch Arnold and his buddy Gerald bounce off a quirky cast of characters .
__label__neutral	It is the sheer , selfish , wound-licking , bar-scrapping doggedness of Leon's struggle to face and transmute his demons that makes the movie a spirited and touching occasion , despite its patchy construction .
__label__positive	It just may inspire a few younger moviegoers to read Stevenson's book , which is a treasure in and of itself .
__label__neutral	It kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others .
__label__negative	It made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen .
__label__neutral	It may seem long at 110 minutes if you're not a fan , because it includes segments of 12 songs at a reunion concert .
__label__positive	It moves quickly , adroitly , and without fuss ; it doesn't give you time to reflect on the inanity -- and the Cold War datedness -- of its premise .
__label__negative	It offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment .
__label__positive	It proves quite compelling as an intense , brooding character study .
__label__positive	It provides an honest look at a community striving to anchor itself in new grounds .
__label__very_positive	It provides the grand , intelligent entertainment of a superior cast playing smart people amid a compelling plot .
__label__positive	It seems like I have been waiting my whole life for this movie and now I can't wait for the sequel .
__label__negative	It showcases Carvey's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one's patience to get to the good stuff .
__label__very_negative	It takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as ` worse than expected , ' but Ghost Ship somehow manages to do exactly that .
__label__very_negative	It takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of Robert Forster , Anne Meara , Eugene Levy , and Reginald VelJohnson all in the same movie .
__label__negative	It takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived .
__label__very_negative	It treats women like idiots .
__label__neutral	It uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color .
__label__positive	It wants to tweak them with a taste of tangy new humor .
__label__positive	It will grip even viewers who aren't interested in rap , as it cuts to the heart of American society in an unnerving way .
__label__neutral	It will not appeal to the impatient , but those who like long books and movies will admire the way it accumulates power and depth .
__label__neutral	Its maker , Steven Spielberg , hasn't had so much fun in two decades , since he was schlepping Indiana Jones around the globe in search of a giant misplaced ashtray .
__label__negative	Its story may be a thousand years old , but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ?
__label__neutral	Jacquot's rendering of Puccini's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera .
__label__negative	Jason X is positively anti-Darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and Jason still kills on auto-pilot .
__label__positive	Jones ... does offer a brutal form of charisma .
__label__very_positive	Jose Campanella delivers a loosely autobiographical story brushed with sentimentality but brimming with gentle humor , bittersweet pathos , and lyric moments that linger like snapshots of memory .
__label__neutral	Just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time .
__label__positive	Just as moving , uplifting and funny as ever .
__label__very_negative	Just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame .
__label__negative	Just one bad idea after another .
__label__very_negative	K-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap Hollywood tension .
__label__neutral	Kept aloft largely by a comically adept ensemble .
__label__positive	Kinnear doesn't aim for our sympathy , but rather delivers a performance of striking skill and depth .
__label__positive	LaPaglia's ability to convey grief and hope works with Weaver's sensitive reactions to make this a two-actor master class .
__label__neutral	Lan Yu is at times too restrained , yet there are moments it captures the erotics of intimacy in a way that makes most American love stories look downright unfree .
__label__negative	Late Marriage's stiffness is unlikely to demonstrate the emotional clout to sweep U.S. viewers off their feet .
__label__very_positive	Leigh's film is full of memorable performances from top to bottom .
__label__negative	Less dizzying than just dizzy , the jaunt is practically over before it begins .
__label__neutral	Let's hope -- shall we ?
__label__positive	Light years \/ several warp speeds \/ levels and levels of dilithium crystals better than the pitiful Insurrection .
__label__positive	Like Leon , it's frustrating and still oddly likable .
__label__very_positive	Like Mike is a winner for kids , and no doubt a winner for Lil Bow Wow , who can now add movies to the list of things he does well .
__label__neutral	Like Mike isn't interested in recycling old cliches .
__label__neutral	Like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all .
__label__very_negative	Like being trapped at a perpetual frat party ... How can something so gross be so boring ?
__label__neutral	Like the Chelsea's denizens ... Burdette's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste .
__label__negative	Like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything's in place but something's just a little off-kilter .
__label__very_negative	Like you couldn't smell this turkey rotting from miles away .
__label__neutral	Likely to expertly drum up repressed teenage memories in any viewer .
__label__positive	Liotta put on 30 pounds for the role , and has completely transformed himself from his smooth , Goodfellas image .
__label__neutral	Long Time Dead ?
__label__very_positive	Looking aristocratic , luminous yet careworn in Jane Hamilton's exemplary costumes , Rampling gives a performance that could not be improved upon . '
__label__negative	Looks and feels like a project better suited for the small screen .
__label__very_positive	Lovely and poignant .
__label__positive	MacDowell , whose wifty Southern charm has anchored lighter affairs ... brings an absolutely riveting conviction to her role .
__label__negative	Made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss .
__label__positive	Majidi is an unconventional storyteller , capable of finding beauty in the most depressing places .
__label__neutral	Makes even the claustrophobic on-board quarters seem fun .
__label__very_negative	Makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience .
__label__neutral	Makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment ... but at least this time there's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff .
__label__very_negative	Manages to be both repulsively sadistic and mundane .
__label__neutral	Manages to be somewhat well-acted , not badly art-directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling , touching or , yikes , uproarious .
__label__very_positive	Manages to be sweet and wickedly satisfying at the same time .
__label__negative	Manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite .
__label__very_positive	Manages to transcend the sex , drugs and show-tunes plot into something far richer .
__label__neutral	Maneuvers skillfully through the plot's hot brine -- until it's undone by the sogginess of its contemporary characters , and actors .
__label__very_positive	Martin and Barbara are complex characters -- sometimes tender , sometimes angry -- and the delicate performances by Sven Wollter and Viveka Seldahl make their hopes and frustrations vivid .
__label__very_negative	Mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity .
__label__very_positive	Maud and Roland's search for an unknowable past makes for a haunting literary detective story , but LaBute pulls off a neater trick in Possession : He makes language sexy .
__label__positive	May be far from the best of the series , but it's assured , wonderfully respectful of its past and thrilling enough to make it abundantly clear that this movie phenomenon has once again reinvented itself for a new generation .
__label__negative	May reawaken discussion of the Kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen .
__label__positive	McConaughey's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script .
__label__very_positive	Michael Gerbosi's script is economically packed with telling scenes .
__label__positive	Miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness .
__label__positive	Minority Report is exactly what the title indicates , a report .
__label__neutral	Mom and Dad can catch some quality naptime along the way .
__label__very_positive	Montias ... pumps a lot of energy into his nicely nuanced narrative and surrounds himself with a cast of quirky -- but not stereotyped -- street characters .
__label__positive	Moody , heartbreaking , and filmed in a natural , unforced style that makes its characters seem entirely convincing even when its script is not .
__label__neutral	More concerned with Sade's ideas than with his actions .
__label__neutral	More maudlin than sharp .
__label__very_positive	More romantic , more emotional and ultimately more satisfying than the teary-eyed original .
__label__negative	More whiny downer than corruscating commentary .
__label__negative	Moretti's compelling anatomy of grief and the difficult process of adapting to loss .
__label__positive	Morton uses her face and her body language to bring us Morvern's soul , even though the character is almost completely deadpan .
__label__negative	Movie fans , get ready to take off ... the other direction .
__label__very_positive	Mr. Tsai is a very original artist in his medium , and What Time Is It There ?
__label__neutral	Much as we might be interested in gratuitous sexualization , Haneke has a different objective in mind -- namely the implications of our craving for fake stimulation .
__label__very_positive	My Big Fat Greek Wedding uses stereotypes in a delightful blend of sweet romance and lovingly dished out humor .
__label__very_positive	My Wife Is an Actress is an utterly charming French comedy that feels so American in sensibility and style it's virtually its own Hollywood remake .
__label__very_negative	My reaction in a word : disappointment .
__label__positive	My thoughts were focused on the characters .
__label__neutral	Nasty , ugly , pointless and depressing , even if you hate clowns .
__label__positive	Neither Parker nor Donovan is a typical romantic lead , but they bring a fresh , quirky charm to the formula .
__label__very_negative	Nelson's brutally unsentimental approach ... sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle .
__label__negative	Nervous breakdowns are not entertaining .
__label__neutral	New Best Friend's Playboy-mansion presentation of college life is laugh-out-loud ludicrous .
__label__negative	Nicks , seemingly uncertain what's going to make people laugh , runs the gamut from stale parody to raunchy sex gags to formula romantic comedy .
__label__very_positive	Nine Queens is not only than a frighteningly capable debut and genre piece , but also a snapshot of a dangerous political situation on the verge of coming to a head .
__label__negative	No aspirations to social import inform the movie version .
__label__very_negative	No one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through The Master of Disguise .
__label__neutral	No one goes unindicted here , which is probably for the best .
__label__very_positive	No screen fantasy-adventure in recent memory has the showmanship of Clones ' last 45 minutes .
__label__very_positive	No sophomore slump for director Sam Mendes , who segues from Oscar winner to Oscar-winning potential with a smooth sleight of hand .
__label__negative	No telegraphing is too obvious or simplistic for this movie .
__label__very_negative	No way I can believe this load of junk .
__label__very_negative	Nonsensical , dull `` cyber-horror '' flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting .
__label__neutral	Not a film to rival To Live , but a fine little amuse-bouche to keep your appetite whetted .
__label__very_negative	Not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions .
__label__negative	Not exactly the Bees Knees
__label__positive	Not far beneath the surface , this reconfigured tale asks disturbing questions about those things we expect from military epics .
__label__neutral	Not for the prurient or squeamish , it's a daring if overlong examination of an idolized culture , self-loathing and sexual politics .
__label__neutral	Not nearly long enough .
__label__very_positive	Not only are the special effects and narrative flow much improved , and Daniel Radcliffe more emotionally assertive this time around as Harry , but the film conjures the magic of author J.K. Rowling's books .
__label__very_positive	Not only is Undercover Brother as funny , if not more so , than both Austin Powers films , but it's also one of the smarter , savvier spoofs to come along in some time .
__label__very_negative	Not only unfunny , but downright repellent .
__label__negative	Not really bad so much as distasteful : We need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers .
__label__very_negative	Not since Freddy Got Fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through .
__label__very_positive	Not since Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa's Ran have the savagery of combat and the specter of death been visualized with such operatic grandeur .
__label__positive	Not since Tom Cruise in Risky Business has an actor made such a strong impression in his underwear .
__label__very_positive	Not the kind of film that will appeal to a mainstream American audience , but there is a certain charm about the film that makes it a suitable entry into the fest circuit .
__label__positive	Nothing's at stake , just a twisty double-cross you can smell a mile away -- still , the derivative Nine Queens is lots of fun .
__label__very_negative	Nothing in Waking Up in Reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay .
__label__neutral	Nothing is black and white .
__label__negative	Nothing is sacred in this gut-buster .
__label__neutral	Nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle .
__label__negative	Of course , by more objective measurements it's still quite bad .
__label__positive	Offers much to enjoy ... and a lot to mull over in terms of love , loyalty and the nature of staying friends .
__label__negative	Offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs ... a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm .
__label__negative	Oh come on .
__label__very_positive	Old-form moviemaking at its best .
__label__neutral	On the bright side , it contains Jesse Ventura's best work since the XFL .
__label__positive	On the heels of The Ring comes a similarly morose and humorless horror movie that , although flawed , is to be commended for its straight-ahead approach to creepiness .
__label__very_negative	On the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality .
__label__very_positive	On this tricky topic , Tadpole is very much a step in the right direction , with its blend of frankness , civility and compassion .
__label__negative	Once the 50 year old Benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back .
__label__positive	One from the heart .
__label__negative	One long string of cliches .
__label__positive	One of creepiest , scariest movies to come along in a long , long time , easily rivaling Blair Witch or The Others .

__label__very_positive	One of the more intelligent children's movies to hit theaters this year .
__label__very_negative	One of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year .
__label__very_positive	One of the most significant moviegoing pleasures of the year .
__label__very_positive	One of the smartest takes on singles culture I've seen in a long time .
__label__very_positive	One of those energetic surprises , an original that pleases almost everyone who sees it .
__label__negative	One of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution .
__label__neutral	Open-minded kids -- kids who read , kids who dream -- will be comforted by the way it deals with big issues like death and destiny .
__label__negative	Or doing last year's taxes with your ex-wife .
__label__negative	Or emptying rat traps .
__label__positive	Oscar Wilde's masterpiece , The Importance of Being Earnest , may be the best play of the 19th century .
__label__negative	Outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent .
__label__neutral	Over age 15 ?
__label__negative	Overall the film feels like a low-budget TV pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube .
__label__positive	Overall very good for what it's trying to do .
__label__very_positive	Pacino is brilliant as the sleep-deprived Dormer , his increasing weariness as much existential as it is physical .
__label__very_negative	Paid In Full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from Brian De Palma's Scarface .
__label__neutral	Part Three Stooges .
__label__negative	Part low rent Godfather .
__label__very_negative	Partway through watching this saccharine , Easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected TV show .
__label__negative	Passable entertainment , but it's the kind of motion picture that won't make much of a splash when it's released , and will not be remembered long afterwards .
__label__very_positive	People cinema at its finest .
__label__negative	Perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie .
__label__negative	Plays like a volatile and overlong W magazine fashion spread .
__label__negative	Portentous and pretentious , The Weight of Water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama .
__label__neutral	Prancing his way through the tailor-made part of a male hooker approaching the end of his vitality , Jagger obviously relishes every self-mocking moment .
__label__very_positive	Preaches to two completely different choirs at the same time , which is a pretty amazing accomplishment .
__label__neutral	Pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery .
__label__very_negative	Professionally speaking , it's tempting to jump ship in January to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller .
__label__negative	Prurient playthings aside , there's little to love about this English trifle .
__label__negative	Pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer Adam Larson Broder and his co-director , Tony R. Abrams , in their feature debut .
__label__negative	Pumpkin takes an admirable look at the hypocrisy of political correctness , but it does so with such an uneven tone that you never know when humor ends and tragedy begins .
__label__neutral	Pumpkin wants to have it both ways .
__label__positive	Puts a human face on a land most Westerners are unfamiliar with .
__label__positive	Ramsay , as in Ratcatcher , remains a filmmaker with an acid viewpoint and a real gift for teasing chilly poetry out of lives and settings that might otherwise seem drab and sordid .
__label__positive	Rare Birds has more than enough charm to make it memorable .
__label__negative	Rarely has leukemia looked so shimmering and benign .
__label__negative	Rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment .
__label__positive	Reggio's continual visual barrage is absorbing as well as thought-provoking .
__label__positive	Reign of Fire looks as if it was made without much thought -- and is best watched that way .
__label__neutral	Remember the kind of movie we were hoping `` Ecks vs. Sever '' or `` xXx '' was going to be ?
__label__neutral	Returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , Sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy .
__label__positive	Richard Gere and Diane Lane put in fine performances as does French actor Oliver Martinez .
__label__neutral	Ruzowitzky has taken this mothball-y stuff and made a rather sturdy , old-fashioned entertainment out of it .
__label__negative	Sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance .
__label__positive	Sade is an engaging look at the controversial eponymous and fiercely atheistic hero .
__label__negative	Sam Mendes has become valedictorian at the School for Soft Landings and Easy Ways Out .
__label__very_negative	Samira Makhmalbaf's new film Blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal
__label__negative	Schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character .
__label__positive	Scooby Dooby Doo \/ And Shaggy too \/ You both look and sound great .
__label__very_negative	Scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence .
__label__neutral	Scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; Perdition , meanwhile , reads more like Driving Miss Daisy than GoodFellas .
__label__negative	Scorsese doesn't give us a character worth giving a damn about .
__label__positive	Seldahl's Barbara is a precise and moving portrait of someone whose world is turned upside down , first by passion and then by illness .
__label__very_positive	Seldom has a movie so closely matched the spirit of a man and his work .
__label__negative	Serving Sara doesn't serve up a whole lot of laughs .
__label__negative	Shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere .
__label__negative	Should have been someone else -
__label__neutral	Simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy .
__label__negative	Sit through this one , and you won't need a magic watch to stop time ; your DVD player will do it for you .
__label__neutral	Skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt .
__label__very_negative	Slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $ 40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ?
__label__positive	Slick piece of cross-promotion .
__label__positive	Smart , provocative and blisteringly funny .
__label__neutral	Smith is careful not to make fun of these curious owners of architectural oddities .
__label__positive	So , too , is this comedy about mild culture clashing in today's New Delhi .
__label__very_negative	So devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like XXX and Collateral Damage seem like thoughtful treatises
__label__positive	So much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie .
__label__positive	So refreshingly incisive is Grant that for the first time he'll probably appeal more to guys than to their girlfriends who drag them to this movie for the Hugh factor .
__label__positive	So unassuming and pure of heart , you can't help but warmly extend your arms and yell ` Safe ! '
__label__very_negative	So unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines .
__label__neutral	Socrates motions for hemlock .
__label__neutral	Some of it is clever , but it is never melodic \/
__label__negative	Some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , Pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny .
__label__positive	Something akin to a Japanese Alice Through the Looking Glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously .
__label__negative	Something like scrubbing the toilet .
__label__neutral	Sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn .
__label__negative	Sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest .
__label__neutral	Star Trek : Nemesis meekly goes where nearly every Star Trek movie has gone before .
__label__negative	Stealing Harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time .
__label__very_negative	Stealing Harvard is evidence that the Farrelly Bros. -- Peter and Bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with Green's half-hearted movie career .
__label__very_positive	Stephen Rea , Aidan Quinn , and Alan Bates play Desmond's legal eagles , and when joined by Brosnan , the sight of this grandiloquent quartet lolling in pretty Irish settings is a pleasant enough thing , ` tis .
__label__very_negative	Sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the WWII-era Mississippi Delta undermine this adaptation .
__label__very_positive	Still , as a visual treat , the film is almost unsurpassed .
__label__very_negative	Stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad .
__label__very_negative	Suffers from the lack of a compelling or comprehensible narrative .
__label__very_negative	Suffocated by its fussy script and uptight characters , this musty adaptation is all the more annoying since it's been packaged and sold back to us by Hollywood .
__label__negative	Sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is Rebecca Romijn-Stamos .
__label__very_negative	Taylor appears to have blown his entire budget on soundtrack rights and had nothing left over for jokes .
__label__negative	Teen movies have really hit the skids .
__label__positive	Thanks to Haynes ' absolute control of the film's mood , and buoyed by three terrific performances , Far From Heaven actually pulls off this stylistic juggling act .
__label__very_positive	Thanks to Scott's charismatic Roger and Eisenberg's sweet nephew , Roger Dodger is one of the most compelling variations on In the Company of Men .
__label__negative	That's a cheat .
__label__negative	That's pure PR hype .
__label__positive	That dogged good will of the parents and ` vain ' Jia's defoliation of ego , make the film touching despite some doldrums .
__label__positive	That is a compliment to Kuras and Miller .
__label__positive	The Chateau cleverly probes the cross-cultural differences between Gauls and Yanks .
__label__negative	The Cold Turkey would've been a far better title .
__label__neutral	The French are rather good at this kind of thing , unlike the Americans , who have a passion for Musketeers , only to spoof them .
__label__very_negative	The Iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did .
__label__positive	The Lion King was a roaring success when it was released eight years ago , but on Imax it seems better , not just bigger .
__label__very_negative	The Man From Elysian Fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves .
__label__neutral	The Movie could have been made 40 years ago , and parents ' appreciation of it may depend on whether they consider that a good thing .
__label__very_negative	The Movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ain't pretty .
__label__positive	The Son's Room is a triumph of gentility that earns its moments of pathos .
__label__positive	The Wild Thornberrys Movie is a jolly surprise .
__label__negative	The X potion gives the quickly named Blossom , Bubbles and Buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately don't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays .
__label__very_positive	The acting , costumes , music , cinematography and sound are all astounding given the production's austere locales .
__label__negative	The action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide .
__label__neutral	The actors are appealing , but Elysian Fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental .
__label__very_negative	The affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to Demme's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled Hollywood post-production effects .
__label__very_positive	The best film about baseball to hit theaters since Field of Dreams .
__label__positive	The best revenge may just be living well because this film , unlike other Dumas adaptations , is far more likened to a treasure than a lengthy jail sentence .
__label__negative	The best that can be said about the work here of Scottish director Ritchie ... is that he obviously doesn't have his heart in it .
__label__negative	The character of ZigZag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him .
__label__very_positive	The characters are interesting and often very creatively constructed from figure to backstory .
__label__positive	The continued good chemistry between Carmen and Juni is what keeps this slightly disappointing sequel going , with enough amusing banter -- blessedly curse-free -- to keep both kids and parents entertained .
__label__negative	The director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom .
__label__neutral	The documentary does little , apart from raising the topic , to further stoke the conversation .
__label__positive	The emotions are raw and will strike a nerve with anyone who's ever had family trauma .
__label__negative	The end result is a film that's neither .
__label__negative	The entire movie is about a boring , sad man being boring and sad .
__label__very_negative	The experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not .
__label__positive	The far future may be awesome to consider , but from period detail to matters of the heart , this film is most transporting when it stays put in the past .
__label__neutral	The film's almost unbearable portrait of sadness and grief transcends its specific story to speak to the ways in which need , history and presumption tangle , and sometimes destroy , blood ties .
__label__neutral	The film's essentially over by the meet-cute .
__label__very_negative	The film's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency .
__label__very_negative	The film's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style .
__label__very_positive	The film's performances are thrilling .
__label__neutral	The film's snags and stumblings are more than compensated for by its wryly subversive tone .
__label__negative	The film's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go .
__label__very_positive	The film's welcome breeziness and some unbelievably hilarious moments -- most portraying the idiocy of the film industry -- make it mostly worth the trip .
__label__negative	The film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when Carvey's Saturday Night Live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment .
__label__negative	The film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle .
__label__neutral	The film is a contrivance , as artificial as the video games Japanese teens play in a nightclub sequence , but it's an enjoyable one .
__label__negative	The film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete , as if the real story starts just around the corner .
__label__positive	The film is beautifully mounted , but , more to the point , the issues are subtly presented , managing to walk a fine line with regard to the question of Joan's madness .
__label__very_positive	The film is powerful , accessible and funny .
__label__very_positive	The film is quiet , threatening and unforgettable .
__label__negative	The film makes a fatal mistake : It asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life .
__label__positive	The film may appear naked in its narrative form ... but it goes deeper than that , to fundamental choices that include the complexity of the Catholic doctrine
__label__neutral	The film serves as a valuable time capsule to remind us of the devastating horror suffered by an entire people .
__label__neutral	The film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , Southern California locations and star power .
__label__negative	The film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip .
__label__positive	The film will play equally well on both the standard and giant screens .
__label__positive	The fly-on-the-wall method used to document rural French school life is a refreshing departure from the now more prevalent technique of the docu-makers being a visible part of their work .
__label__positive	The format gets used best ... to capture the dizzying heights achieved by motocross and BMX riders , whose balletic hotdogging occasionally ends in bone-crushing screwups .
__label__neutral	The ga-zillionth airhead movie about a wife in distress who resorts to desperate measures .
__label__very_negative	The heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence .
__label__negative	The humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant .
__label__very_negative	The humor isn't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original .
__label__neutral	The idea of 49-year-old Roberto Benigni playing the wooden boy Pinocchio is scary enough .
__label__neutral	The inhospitability of the land emphasizes the spare precision of the narratives and helps to give them an atavistic power , as if they were tales that had been handed down since the beginning of time .
__label__positive	The inspirational screenplay by Mike Rich covers a lot of ground , perhaps too much , but ties things together , neatly , by the end .
__label__positive	The jabs it employs are short , carefully placed and dead-center .
__label__neutral	The kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated .
__label__negative	The last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage American road-trip drek we've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes
__label__negative	The longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it's actually pretty good in the first few minutes .
__label__negative	The lower your expectations , the more you'll enjoy it .
__label__positive	The magic of the film lies not in the mysterious spring but in the richness of its performances .
__label__very_positive	The mesmerizing performances of the leads keep the film grounded and keep the audience riveted .
__label__neutral	The messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated Old Testament tale of Jonah and the Whale .
__label__very_positive	The most compelling Wiseman epic of recent years .
__label__very_negative	The most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take .
__label__negative	The movie's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach .
__label__positive	The movie's relatively simple plot and uncomplicated morality play well with the affable cast .
__label__negative	The movie , directed by Mick Jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting .
__label__positive	The movie does a good job of laying out some of the major issues that we encounter as we journey through life .
__label__negative	The movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts .
__label__negative	The movie is Dawn of the Dead crossed with John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second .
__label__very_positive	The movie is beautiful to behold and engages one in a sense of epic struggle -- inner and outer -- that's all too rare in Hollywood's hastier productions .
__label__neutral	The movie is for fans who can't stop loving anime , and the fanatical excess built into it .
__label__very_positive	The movie isn't just hilarious : It's witty and inventive , too , and in hindsight , it isn't even all that dumb .
__label__neutral	The movie occasionally threatens to become didactic , but it's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge .
__label__very_positive	The movie understands like few others how the depth and breadth of emotional intimacy give the physical act all of its meaning and most of its pleasure .
__label__very_negative	The moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess's home video of their baby's birth .
__label__neutral	The next generation of mob movie .
__label__very_negative	The notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy .
__label__very_positive	The old-world - meets-new mesh is incarnated in the movie's soundtrack , a joyful effusion of disco Bollywood that , by the end of Monsoon Wedding , sent my spirit soaring out of the theater .
__label__very_negative	The only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater .
__label__negative	The overall effect is less like a children's movie than a recruitment film for future Hollywood sellouts .
__label__very_positive	The performances take the movie to a higher level .
__label__positive	The piece plays as well as it does thanks in large measure to Anspaugh's three lead actresses .
__label__negative	The piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones .
__label__very_negative	The plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience's chain .
__label__positive	The primitive force of this film seems to bubble up from the vast collective memory of the combatants .
__label__negative	The problem with this film is that it lacks focus .
__label__positive	The quality of the art combined with the humor and intelligence of the script allow the filmmakers to present the biblical message of forgiveness without it ever becoming preachy or syrupy .
__label__negative	The reality of the new live-action Pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque .
__label__negative	The result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a Halloween that died .
__label__negative	The script kicks in , and Mr. Hartley's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow .
__label__very_positive	The second coming of Harry Potter is a film far superior to its predecessor .
__label__positive	The sort of film that makes me miss Hitchcock , but also feel optimistic that there's hope for popular cinema yet .
__label__positive	The special effects and many scenes of weightlessness look as good or better than in the original , while the Oscar-winning sound and James Horner's rousing score make good use of the hefty audio system .
__label__positive	The story and structure are well-honed .
__label__negative	The story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships .
__label__neutral	The stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious .
__label__positive	The structure the film takes may find Matt Damon and Ben Affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a Good Will Hunting trilogy that was never planned .
__label__positive	The subtle strength of `` Elling '' is that it never loses touch with the reality of the grim situation .
__label__negative	The talented and clever Robert Rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and didn't reserve enough for his second .
__label__neutral	The techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are Chan and Hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we can't recommend anything but a rental for The Tuxedo .
__label__very_positive	The terrific and bewilderingly underrated Campbell Scott gives a star performance that is nothing short of mesmerizing .
__label__negative	The title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well .
__label__neutral	The twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows .
__label__positive	The very definition of the ` small ' movie , but it is a good stepping stone for director Sprecher .
__label__neutral	The vintage is pure ' 87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : Fatal Attraction = don't have an affair with a nutjob ; Unfaithful = don't if you're married to one .
__label__positive	The vitality of the actors keeps the intensity of the film high , even as the strafings blend together .
__label__positive	The vivid lead performances sustain interest and empathy , but the journey is far more interesting than the final destination .
__label__positive	The volatile dynamics of female friendship is the subject of this unhurried , low-key film that is so off-Hollywood that it seems positively French in its rhythms and resonance .
__label__positive	The weight of the piece , the unerring professionalism of the chilly production , and the fascination embedded in the lurid topic prove recommendation enough .
__label__neutral	The whole is quite entertaining , but despite its virtues , there is an unsettled feeling to the film .
__label__very_negative	The words , ` Frankly , my dear , I don't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate .
__label__positive	Thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big , colorful characters .
__label__positive	There's ... tremendous energy from the cast , a sense of playfulness and excitement that seems appropriate .
__label__neutral	There's a solid woman - finding-herself story somewhere in here , but you'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it .
__label__positive	There's a wickedly subversive bent to the best parts of Birthday Girl .
__label__negative	There's enough melodrama in this Magnolia Primavera to make PTA proud yet director Muccino's characters are less worthy of Puccini than they are of daytime television .
__label__negative	There's no emotional pulse to Solaris .
__label__negative	There's not enough here to justify the almost two hours .
__label__positive	There's really only one good idea in this movie , but the director runs with it and presents it with an unforgettable visual panache .
__label__positive	There's something auspicious , and daring , too , about the artistic instinct that pushes a majority-oriented director like Steven Spielberg to follow A.I. with this challenging report so liable to unnerve the majority .
__label__neutral	There's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like Lavinia , to go the conservative route .
__label__negative	There's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging .
__label__very_negative	There are plot holes big enough for Shamu the killer whale to swim through .
__label__negative	There are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part Sliding Doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them .
__label__very_positive	There are some wonderfully fresh moments that smooth the moral stiffness with human kindness and hopefulness .
__label__neutral	There can be no other explanation .
__label__positive	There has always been something likable about the Marquis de Sade .
__label__positive	There is a fabric of complex ideas here , and feelings that profoundly deepen them .
__label__negative	There isn't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients .
__label__very_negative	There is no pleasure in watching a child suffer .
__label__positive	There is nothing outstanding about this film , but it is good enough and will likely be appreciated most by sailors and folks who know their way around a submarine .
__label__negative	There is very little dread or apprehension , and though I like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill .
__label__very_negative	There ought to be a directing license , so that Ed Burns can have his revoked .
__label__negative	There seems to be no clear path as to where the story's going , or how long it's going to take to get there .
__label__negative	They should have called it Gutterball .
__label__neutral	They takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending .
__label__negative	This Nickleby thing might have more homosexual undertones than an Eddie Murphy film .
__label__neutral	This directorial debut from music video show-off Higuchinsky is all flash .
__label__neutral	This disturbing bio-pic is hard to forget .
__label__negative	This film seems thirsty for reflection , itself taking on adolescent qualities .
__label__very_positive	This flick is about as cool and crowd-pleasing as a documentary can get .
__label__positive	This illuminating documentary transcends our preconceived vision of the Holy Land and its inhabitants , revealing the human complexities beneath .
__label__very_positive	This is a good script , good dialogue , funny even for adults .
__label__very_negative	This is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars .
__label__positive	This is a story of two misfits who don't stand a chance alone , but together they are magnificent .
__label__negative	This is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs .
__label__very_positive	This is a winning ensemble comedy that shows Canadians can put gentle laughs and equally gentle sentiments on the button , just as easily as their counterparts anywhere else in the world .
__label__neutral	This is as respectful a film as Byatt fans could hope for , though lovers of the book may wonder why it's necessary .
__label__neutral	This is her Blue Lagoon .
__label__positive	This is human comedy at its most amusing , interesting and confirming .
__label__neutral	This is it .
__label__negative	This isn't even Madonna's Swept Away .
__label__very_negative	This is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience .
__label__neutral	This is nothing but familiar territory .
__label__very_negative	This is so bad .
__label__negative	This is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing .
__label__very_positive	This is wild surreal stuff , but brilliant and the camera just kind of sits there and lets you look at this and its like you're going from one room to the next and none of them have any relation to the other .
__label__neutral	This movie is a snow emergency .
__label__negative	This movie is maddening .
__label__very_negative	This movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work .
__label__negative	This movie seems to have been written using Mad-libs .
__label__very_negative	This one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics .
__label__very_negative	This piece of Channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast .
__label__neutral	This rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that's about all it does well .
__label__very_negative	This re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against .
__label__neutral	This remake gets all there is to get out of a peculiar premise with promise : Al Pacino loathing Robin Williams .
__label__negative	This riveting World War II moral suspense story deals with the shadow side of American culture : racial prejudice in its ugly and diverse forms .
__label__positive	This surreal Gilliam-esque film is also a troubling interpretation of Ecclesiastes .
__label__positive	This tenth feature is a big deal , indeed -- at least the third-best , and maybe even a notch above the previous runner-up , Nicholas Meyer's Star Trek VI : The Undiscovered Country .
__label__negative	This time Mr. Burns is trying something in the Martin Scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again .
__label__neutral	Though Catch Me If You Can isn't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie .
__label__negative	Though Moonlight Mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama .
__label__negative	Though Perry and Hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by Jay Scherick and David Ronn , neither the actors nor director Reginald Hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .
__label__positive	Though it's become almost redundant to say so , major kudos go to Leigh for actually casting people who look working-class .
__label__positive	Though only 60 minutes long , the film is packed with information and impressions .
__label__negative	To call The Other Side of Heaven `` appalling '' would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be .
__label__neutral	To my taste , the film's comic characters come perilously close to being Amoses and Andys for a new generation .
__label__negative	To say this was done better in Wilder's Some Like It Hot is like saying the sun rises in the east .
__label__very_negative	Too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped .
__label__negative	Too much of the humor falls flat .
__label__very_negative	Too often , the viewer isn't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance .
__label__negative	Too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging ... The Isle defies an easy categorization .
__label__negative	Too slow , too long and too little happens .
__label__positive	Trademark American triteness and simplicity are tossed out the window with the intelligent French drama that deftly explores the difficult relationship between a father and son .
__label__positive	Travels a fascinating arc from hope and euphoria to reality and disillusionment .
__label__negative	Tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar .
__label__very_negative	Trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive .
__label__positive	True tale of courage -- and complicity -- at Auschwitz is a harrowing drama that tries to tell of the unspeakable .
__label__very_negative	Try as I may , I can't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , ` Thank you ! '
__label__positive	Turns potentially forgettable formula into something strangely diverting .
__label__very_positive	Two hours fly by -- opera's a pleasure when you don't have to endure intermissions -- and even a novice to the form comes away exhilarated .
__label__very_negative	Ultimately feels empty and unsatisfying , like swallowing a Communion wafer without the wine .
__label__negative	Uncommonly stylish but equally silly ... the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions .
__label__neutral	Under 15 ?
__label__negative	Unflinchingly bleak and desperate
__label__very_negative	Unfortunately , it's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies .
__label__very_positive	Unlike the speedy wham-bam effect of most Hollywood offerings , character development -- and more importantly , character empathy -- is at the heart of Italian for Beginners .
__label__very_positive	Uses high comedy to evoke surprising poignance .
__label__very_positive	Uses sharp humor and insight into human nature to examine class conflict , adolescent yearning , the roots of friendship and sexual identity .
__label__negative	Utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , Roberto Benigni's Pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film .
__label__neutral	Van Wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase ` comedy gag . '
__label__neutral	Van Wilder doesn't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like Tomcats , Freddy Got Fingered , and Slackers .
__label__negative	Velocity represents everything wrong with '' independent film '' as a commodified , sold-out concept on the American filmmaking scene .
__label__negative	Vera's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them .
__label__negative	Verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies .
__label__very_negative	Very bad .
__label__positive	Very psychoanalytical -- provocatively so -- and also refreshingly literary .
__label__negative	Very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality can't hide the giant Achilles ' heel in `` Stuart Little 2 `` : There's just no story , folks .
__label__neutral	Viewers of `` The Ring '' are more likely to remember the haunting images than the plot holes .
__label__very_positive	Visually imaginative , thematically instructive and thoroughly delightful , it takes us on a roller-coaster ride from innocence to experience without even a hint of that typical kiddie-flick sentimentality .
__label__negative	Visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide Treasure Planet entirely and completely reimagine it .
__label__neutral	Walter Hill's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama Undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity .
__label__very_positive	Warm Water Under a Red Bridge is a quirky and poignant Japanese film that explores the fascinating connections between women , water , nature , and sexuality .
__label__very_positive	We haven't seen such hilarity since Say It Isn't So !
__label__positive	We know the plot's a little crazy , but it held my interest from start to finish .
__label__neutral	We learn a lot about dying coral and see a lot of life on the reef .
__label__neutral	Weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger .
__label__very_negative	Well-nigh unendurable ... though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull .
__label__very_negative	Whaley's determination to immerse you in sheer , unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting .
__label__neutral	What's next : `` My Mother the Car ? ''
__label__positive	What's surprising about Full Frontal is that despite its overt self-awareness , parts of the movie still manage to break past the artifice and thoroughly engage you .
__label__neutral	What Time Is It There ?
__label__positive	What better message than ` love thyself ' could young women of any size receive ?
__label__positive	What distinguishes Time of Favor from countless other thrillers is its underlying concern with the consequences of words and with the complicated emotions fueling terrorist acts .
__label__very_negative	What is 100 % missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting .
__label__negative	What the director can't do is make either of Val Kilmer's two personas interesting or worth caring about .
__label__positive	What the film lacks in general focus it makes up for in compassion , as Corcuera manages to find the seeds of hope in the form of collective action .
__label__negative	What was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian .
__label__very_negative	When the film ended , I felt tired and drained and wanted to lie on my own deathbed for a while .
__label__neutral	Whenever its story isn't bogged down by idiocy involving the CIA and a lost U.S. satellite , Hunter -- starring Irwin and his American wife\/colleague , Terri -- is a movie children should enjoy .
__label__neutral	Whereas last year's exemplary Sexy Beast seemed to revitalize the British gangster movie , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it .
__label__positive	Whether writer-director Anne Fontaine's film is a ghost story , an account of a nervous breakdown , a trip down memory lane , all three or none of the above , it is as seductive as it is haunting .
__label__positive	Whether you like rap music or loathe it , you can't deny either the tragic loss of two young men in the prime of their talent or the power of this movie .
__label__neutral	Which isn't to say that it's the equal of some of its predecessors .
__label__positive	While Undisputed isn't exactly a high , it is a gripping , tidy little movie that takes Mr. Hill higher than he's been in a while .
__label__neutral	While it's nice to watch a movie that hasn't been focus-grouped into tedium , Yu's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold .
__label__neutral	While it regards 1967 as the key turning point of the 20th century , and returns again and again to images of dissidents in the streets , it's alarmingly current .
__label__positive	While its careful pace and seemingly opaque story may not satisfy every moviegoer's appetite , the film's final scene is soaringly , transparently moving .
__label__positive	While locals will get a kick out of spotting Cleveland sites , the rest of the world will enjoy a fast-paced comedy with quirks that might make the award-winning Coen brothers envious .
__label__neutral	While much of the cast has charm -- especially Allodi and Nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy .
__label__negative	While the Resident Evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these .
__label__very_positive	While the ideas about techno-saturation are far from novel , they're presented with a wry dark humor .
__label__neutral	While the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target .
__label__neutral	While the stoically delivered hokum of Hart's War is never fun , it's still a worthy addition to the growing canon of post-Saving Private Ryan tributes to the greatest generation .
__label__positive	While there's something intrinsically funny about Sir Anthony Hopkins saying ` Get in the car , bitch , ' this Jerry Bruckheimer production has little else to offer
__label__neutral	Who needs love like this ?
__label__very_negative	Why make a documentary about these marginal historical figures ?
__label__very_positive	Will amuse and provoke adventurous adults in specialty venues .
__label__very_negative	Wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by Silly Putty and Kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test Trekkie loyalty .
__label__positive	With Rabbit-Proof Fence , Noyce has tailored an epic tale into a lean , economical movie .
__label__neutral	With an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , Soderbergh's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff .
__label__negative	With its dogged Hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , Windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap .
__label__very_negative	With the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by Cedric the Entertainer as Perry's boss , there isn't a redeeming moment here .
__label__positive	With tightly organized efficiency , numerous flashbacks and a constant edge of tension , Miller's film is one of 2002's involvingly adult surprises .
__label__negative	With virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , Chelsea Walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge .
__label__positive	Without ever becoming didactic , director Carlos Carrera expertly weaves this novelistic story of entangled interrelationships and complex morality .
__label__neutral	Without the dark spookiness of Crystal Lake Camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace .
__label__positive	Woody Allen's latest is an ambling , broad comedy about all there is to love -- and hate -- about the movie biz .
__label__negative	Works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them .
__label__positive	Worth watching for Dong Jie's performance -- and for the way it documents a culture in the throes of rapid change .
__label__neutral	Wouldn't one about their famous dad , author of Death in Venice , etc. , be more valuable ?
__label__very_positive	Writer-director's Mehta's effort has tons of charm and the whimsy is in the mixture , the intoxicating masala , of cultures and film genres .
__label__positive	Writer\/director Joe Carnahan's grimy crime drama is a manual of precinct cliches , but it moves fast enough to cover its clunky dialogue and lapses in logic .
__label__neutral	Writer\/director Mark Romanek spotlights the underlying caste system in America .
__label__very_positive	Yakusho and Shimizu ... create engaging characterizations in Imamura's lively and enjoyable cultural mix .
__label__neutral	Yes , Ballistic is silly .
__label__very_negative	Yes , dull .
__label__positive	You'll gasp appalled and laugh outraged and possibly , watching the spectacle of a promising young lad treading desperately in a nasty sea , shed an errant tear .
__label__very_positive	You don't have to know about music to appreciate the film's easygoing blend of comedy and romance .
__label__very_negative	You really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this .
__label__positive	You will emerge with a clearer view of how the gears of justice grind on and the death report comes to share airtime alongside the farm report .
__label__negative	You won't like Roger , but you will quickly recognize him .
__label__neutral	You won't miss its messages , but you'll be entertained as well .
__label__negative	You wonder why Enough wasn't just a music video rather than a full-length movie .
__label__negative	Zaidan's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight .
__label__positive	Zhang ... has done an amazing job of getting realistic performances from his mainly nonprofessional cast .

__label__very_positive	` Easily my choice for one of the year's best films . '
__label__neutral	` They ' begins and ends with scenes so terrifying I'm still stunned .
__label__very_positive	`` Mostly Martha '' is a bright , light modern day family parable that wears its heart on its sleeve for all to see .
__label__neutral	`` The Ring '' is pretty much an English-language copy of the film that inspired it , and it carries the same strengths and flaws .
__label__very_negative	`` The Time Machine '' is a movie that has no interest in itself .
__label__negative	a by-the-numbers patient\/doctor pic that covers all the usual ground
__label__negative	a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes .

__label__very_positive	deliriously funny , fast and loose , accessible to the uninitiated , and full of surprises
__label__positive	does paint some memorable images ... , but Makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters
__label__neutral	essentially an exceptionally well-written , well-edited , well-directed , well-acted , bald rip-off of Aliens .
__label__positive	if you are an actor who can relate to the search for inner peace by dramatically depicting the lives of others onstage , then Esther's story is a compelling quest for truth .
__label__neutral	is not easy .
__label__negative	it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so
__label__negative	just not campy enough
__label__neutral	may not have generated many sparks , but with his affection for Astoria and its people he has given his tale a warm glow .
__label__neutral	should be seen at the very least for its spasms of absurdist humor .
__label__positive	the film tunes into a grief that could lead a man across centuries .
__label__very_positive	what really makes it special is that it pulls us into its world , gives us a hero whose suffering and triumphs we can share , surrounds him with interesting characters and sends us out of the theater feeling we've shared a great adventure .
