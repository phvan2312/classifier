__label__positive	... breathes surprising new life into the familiar by amalgamating genres and adding true human complexity to its not-so-stock characters . '

__label__neutral	... understands that a generation defines its music as much as the music defines a generation .
__label__very_negative	... watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life .
__label__very_negative	... with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , I realized this is a throwaway movie that won't stand the test of time .

__label__negative	A bravura exercise in emptiness .
__label__very_positive	A breezy , diverting , conventional , well-acted tale of two men locked in an ongoing game of cat-and-cat .

__label__very_positive	A thoughtful , provocative , insistently humanizing film .
__label__positive	A thoughtful look at a painful incident that made headlines in 1995 .

__label__neutral	A trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home .
__label__very_positive	A triumph , relentless and beautiful in its downbeat darkness .

__label__negative	About as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through .
__label__positive	About nowhere kids who appropriated turfs as they found them and become self-made celebrity athletes -- a low-down version of the American dream .
__label__negative	Absorbing and disturbing -- perhaps more disturbing than originally intended -- but a little clarity would have gone a long way .

__label__neutral	All prints of this film should be sent to and buried on Pluto .
__label__very_negative	All the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable .
__label__negative	All the necessary exposition prevents the picture from rising above your generic sand 'n' sandal adventure .
__label__very_positive	All the performances are top notch and , once you get through the accents , All or Nothing becomes an emotional , though still positive , wrench of a sit .
__label__very_negative	All the well-meaningness in the world can't erase the fact that The Believer feels like a 12-Step Program for the Jewish Nazi .
__label__very_negative	All these developments and challenges facing Santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility .
__label__negative	All this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull .

__label__very_negative	Although based on a real-life person , John , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours .
__label__positive	Although it's a bit smug and repetitive , this documentary engages your brain in a way few current films do .
__label__positive	Although it bangs a very cliched drum at times , this crowd-pleaser's fresh dialogue , energetic music , and good-natured spunk are often infectious .
__label__neutral	Although the editing might have been tighter , Hush !
__label__negative	Although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result doesn't fully satisfy either the die-hard Jason fans or those who can take a good joke .
__label__positive	Although very much like the first movie based on J.K. Rowling's phenomenal fantasy best sellers , this second go-round possesses a quite pleasing , headlong thrust and a likably delinquent attitude .
__label__negative	An Afterschool Special without the courage of its convictions .
__label__positive	An absorbing , slice-of-depression life that touches nerves and rings true .
__label__positive	An absorbing trip into the minds and motivations of people under stress as well as a keen , unsentimental look at variations on the theme of motherhood .

__label__positive	As blunt as it is in depicting child abuse , El Bola is a movie steeped in an ambiguity that lends its conflicts a symbolic resonance .
__label__negative	As conceived by Mr. Schaeffer , Christopher and Grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell .
__label__very_negative	As elegantly crafted as it often is , Anderson's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame .

__label__negative	As it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters ' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them .
__label__positive	As lo-fi as the special effects are , the folks who cobbled Nemesis together indulge the force of humanity over hardware in a way that George Lucas has long forgotten .
__label__positive	As shaky as the plot is , Kaufman's script is still memorable for some great one-liners .
__label__positive	As teen movies go , `` Orange County '' is a refreshing change
__label__very_positive	As the story moves inexorably through its seven day timeframe , the picture becomes increasingly mesmerizing .
__label__very_negative	As with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure .
__label__very_negative	As written by Michael Berg and Michael J. Wilson from a story by Wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all .

__label__neutral	Asia authors herself as Anna Battista , an Italian superstar and aspiring directress who just happens to be her own worst enemy .

__label__negative	Aspires for the piquant but only really achieves a sort of ridiculous sourness .
__label__positive	At about 95 minutes , Treasure Planet maintains a brisk pace as it races through the familiar story .
__label__negative	At first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin .
__label__very_positive	At heart the movie is a deftly wrought suspense yarn whose richer shadings work as coloring rather than substance .
__label__positive	At its best , The Good Girl is a refreshingly adult take on adultery ...
__label__positive	At its best early on as it plays the culture clashes between the brothers .
__label__negative	At nearly three hours , the whole of Safe Conduct is less than the sum of its parts .
__label__negative	At the bottom rung of the series ' entries .
__label__negative	At times , however , Dogtown and Z-Boys lapses into an insider's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about .
__label__very_positive	At times funny and at other times candidly revealing , it's an intriguing look at two performers who put themselves out there because they love what they do .
__label__positive	Attal mixes comedy with a serious exploration of ego and jealousy within a seemingly serene marriage .
__label__very_negative	Audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school .
__label__negative	Audiences conditioned to getting weepy over saucer-eyed , downy-cheeked moppets and their empathetic caretakers will probably feel emotionally cheated by the film's tart , sugar-free wit .
__label__negative	Audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the Castro regime in less than saintly tones .
__label__very_negative	Automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf .
__label__very_positive	Awkward but sincere and , ultimately , it wins you over .
__label__very_negative	Bad Company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script .
__label__very_negative	Bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description .
__label__neutral	Baran isn't the most transporting or gripping film from Iran -- or , indeed , by its director -- but it's a worthy companion to the many fine , focused films emerging from that most surprising of nations .
__label__negative	Barely goes beyond comic book status .
__label__very_positive	Barney has created a tour de force that is weird , wacky and wonderful .
__label__very_negative	Bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that .
__label__negative	Based on a David Leavitt story , the film shares that writer's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness .
__label__negative	Bears is bad .
__label__neutral	Bears resemblance to , and shares the weaknesses of , too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences .
__label__negative	Before long , the film starts playing like General Hospital crossed with a Saturday Night Live spoof of Dog Day Afternoon .
__label__very_negative	Began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course .
__label__negative	Begins as a promising meditation on one of America's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt .
__label__neutral	Behan himself knew how to spin a tale and one can't help but think he'd appreciate this attempt to turn his life into art .
__label__positive	Behind the snow games and lovable Siberian huskies -LRB- plus one sheep dog -RRB- , the picture hosts a parka-wrapped dose of heart .
__label__negative	Being author Wells ' great-grandson , you'd think filmmaker Simon Wells would have more reverence for the material .
__label__neutral	Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan , Tom Clancy's intrepid hero ?
__label__positive	Benefits from a strong performance from Zhao , but it's Dong Jie's face you remember at the end .
__label__neutral	Bennett's dramatization of her personal descent into post-breakup perdition has a morbid appeal that's tough to shake .
__label__neutral	Besides , real movie producers aren't this nice .
__label__very_negative	Better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine .
__label__negative	Between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap .
__label__neutral	Between the drama of Cube ?
__label__negative	Beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines ... there just isn't much to laugh at .
__label__negative	Big Fat Liar is just futile silliness looking to tap into the kiddie sensibilities .
__label__neutral	Big deal !
__label__very_positive	Biggie and Tupac is so single-mindedly daring , it puts far more polished documentaries to shame .
__label__very_positive	Binoche and Magimel are perfect in these roles .
__label__negative	Birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it .
__label__negative	Blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but Ahola is simply not an actor .
__label__neutral	Boisterous and daft documentary .
__label__negative	Boring we didn't .
__label__negative	Borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu .
__label__neutral	Both awful and appealing .
__label__positive	Both deeply weird and charmingly dear .
__label__neutral	Both stars manage to be funny , but , like the recent I Spy , the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie .
__label__neutral	Bourne , Jason Bourne .
__label__very_positive	Bow's best moments are when he's getting busy on the basketball court because that's when he really scores .
__label__positive	Branagh , in his most forceful non-Shakespeare screen performance , grounds even the softest moments in the angry revolt of his wit .
__label__neutral	Bright seems alternately amused and disgusted with this material , and he can't help throwing in a few of his own touches .
__label__very_positive	Brilliant ! '
__label__neutral	Brimful .
__label__positive	Britney has been delivered to the big screen safe and sound , the way we like our 20-year-old superstar girls to travel on the fame freeway .
__label__very_positive	Bubba Ho-Tep is a wonderful film with a bravura lead performance by Bruce Campbell that doesn't deserve to leave the building until everyone is aware of it .
__label__very_negative	Bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
__label__positive	Bullock does a good job here of working against her natural likability .
__label__negative	But I wasn't .
__label__negative	But an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents Nettelbeck's film from coming together .
__label__very_negative	But as a movie , it's a humorless , disjointed mess .
__label__positive	But based on CQ , I'll certainly be keeping an eye out for his next project .
__label__negative	But buying into sham truths and routine `` indie '' filmmaking , Freundlich has made just another safe movie .
__label__negative	But even a hero can stumble sometimes .
__label__positive	But fans should have fun meeting a brand-new Pokemon called Celebi .
__label__negative	But hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .
__label__negative	But he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person .
__label__positive	But he somehow pulls it off .
__label__very_negative	But here's the real damn : It isn't funny , either .
__label__very_positive	But if it is indeed a duty of art to reflect life , than Leigh has created a masterful piece of artistry right here .
__label__neutral	But if you expect light romantic comedy , good gosh , will you be shocked .
__label__neutral	But in 2002 , such revelations wilt .
__label__very_negative	But in its child-centered , claustrophobic context , it can be just as frightening and disturbing -- even punishing .
__label__positive	But it's emotionally engrossing , too , thanks to strong , credible performances from the whole cast .
__label__positive	But it offers plenty to ponder and chew on as its unusual relationship slowly unfolds .
__label__negative	But it pays a price for its intricate intellectual gamesmanship .
__label__very_negative	But like Bruce Springsteen's gone-to-pot Asbury Park , New Jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a City of ruins .
__label__negative	But like most rabbits , it seems to lack substance .
__label__positive	But some unexpected zigs and zags help .
__label__negative	But that's just the problem with it - the director hasn't added enough of his own ingredients .
__label__negative	But the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored .
__label__very_negative	But this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film .
__label__negative	But this time there's some mold on the gold .
__label__very_positive	But watching Huppert , a great actress tearing into a landmark role , is riveting .
__label__neutral	But what about the countless other people who'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ?
__label__negative	But what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing .
__label__very_positive	But what spectacular sizzle it is !
__label__neutral	But you'll definitely want the T-shirt .
__label__positive	By presenting an impossible romance in an impossible world , Pumpkin dares us to say why either is impossible -- which forces us to confront what's possible and what we might do to make it so .
__label__neutral	By taking Entertainment Tonight subject matter and giving it humor and poignancy , Auto Focus becomes both gut-bustingly funny and crushingly depressing .
__label__negative	By the end , I was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious .
__label__positive	By the end of No Such Thing the audience , like Beatrice , has a watchful affection for the monster .

__label__very_positive	Call me a wimp , but I cried , not once , but three times in this animated sweet film .
__label__very_negative	Calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it's more like entertainment for trolls .
__label__positive	Cantet perfectly captures the hotel lobbies , two-lane highways , and roadside cafes that permeate Vincent's days
__label__very_positive	Cedar takes a very open-minded approach to this sensitive material , showing impressive control , both visually and in the writing .
__label__very_positive	Celebrated at Sundance , this slight comedy of manners has winning performances and a glossy , glib charm that's hard to beat .
__label__neutral	Chalk it up to my adoration for both De Niro and Murphy , but I had a pretty good time with this movie - despite its myriad flaws .
__label__neutral	Chao was Chen Kaige's assistant for years in China .
__label__negative	Chaotic , self-indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it's ... like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature-length horror .
__label__negative	Characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better .
__label__very_positive	Chicago is , in many ways , an admirable achievement .
__label__very_positive	Chicago is sophisticated , brash , sardonic , completely joyful in its execution .
__label__very_positive	Children may not understand everything that happens -- I'm not sure even Miyazaki himself does -- but they will almost certainly be fascinated , and undoubtedly delighted .
__label__negative	Cho's fans are sure to be entertained ; it's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- I'm not one of them .
__label__very_positive	Cho's fearless in picking apart human foibles , not afraid to lay her life bare in front of an audience .
__label__very_negative	Choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy .
__label__positive	Christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their Lord as a luv-spreading Dr. Feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise God for delivering such an instant camp classic .
__label__positive	City by the Sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : It's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes .
__label__positive	Claude Miller airs out a tight plot with an easy pace and a focus on character drama over crime-film complications .
__label__positive	Clever , brutal and strangely soulful movie .
__label__negative	Cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke .
__label__negative	Collateral Damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9 \/ 11 , an antique , in the end .
__label__very_positive	Compelling as it is exotic , Fast Runner has a plot that rivals Shakespeare for intrigue , treachery and murder .
__label__positive	Compelling revenge thriller , though somewhat weakened by a miscast leading lady .
__label__negative	Consider the title's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept .
__label__negative	Considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well .
__label__negative	Consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than Ali G
__label__very_negative	Could The Country Bears really be as bad as its trailers ?
__label__negative	Could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes Fatal Attraction look like a classic by comparison ?
__label__very_negative	Credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter .
__label__negative	Credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment .
__label__positive	Credit must be given to Harland Williams , Michael Rosenbaum and Barry Watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves
__label__negative	Creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller .
__label__neutral	Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of cheese , indeed .
__label__positive	Culkin , who's in virtually every scene , shines as a young man who uses sarcastic lies like a shield .
__label__negative	Culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character .
__label__very_positive	Cute , funny , heartwarming digitally animated feature film with plenty of slapstick humor for the kids , lots of in-jokes for the adults and heart enough for everyone .
__label__neutral	Cuts right through the B.S. giving a big middle-fingered `` shut up '' to those who talk up what is nothing more than two guys beating the hell outta one another .
__label__neutral	D.J. Qualls as Indiana Jones ?
__label__very_positive	Daring , mesmerizing and exceedingly hard to forget .
__label__very_positive	Dark , resonant , inventively detailed and packed with fleet turns of plot and a feast of visual amazement .

__label__very_positive	Davis has filled out his cast with appealing fresh faces .
__label__negative	Dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it doesn't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding .
__label__positive	Day is not a great Bond movie , but it is a good Bond movie , which still makes it much better than your typical Bond knock-offs .
__label__very_positive	Dazzling and sugar-sweet , a blast of shallow magnificence that only sex , scandal , and a chorus line of dangerous damsels can deliver .
__label__positive	De Niro and McDormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story's inability to create interest .
__label__very_negative	De Niro looks bored , Murphy recycles Murphy , and you mentally add Showtime to the pile of Hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal .
__label__very_negative	De Niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to Clint Eastwood in the lazy Bloodwork .
__label__very_positive	De Oliveira creates an emotionally rich , poetically plump and visually fulsome , but never showy , film whose bittersweet themes are reinforced and brilliantly personified by Michel Piccoli .
__label__negative	Demands too much of most viewers .
__label__negative	Demme's loose approach kills the suspense .
__label__very_positive	Denis and co-writer Michele Petin's impeccable screenplay penetrates with a rawness that that is both unflinching and tantalizing .
__label__very_negative	Denzel Washington's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony .
__label__very_negative	Desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats .
__label__negative	Despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director Peter Mattei's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy .
__label__negative	Despite a powerful portrayal by Binoche , it's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum .
__label__positive	Despite a story predictable enough to make The Sound of Music play like a nail-biting thriller , its heart is so much in the right place it is difficult to get really peeved at it .
__label__neutral	Despite all the talking , by the time the bloody climax arrives we still don't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another .
__label__neutral	Despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry , Witherspoon is just too dialed-up to be America's Sweetheart .
__label__positive	Despite its flaws , Secretary stays in your head and makes you question your own firmly held positions .
__label__neutral	Despite its good nature and some genuinely funny moments , Super Troopers suffers from a bad case of arrested development .
__label__neutral	Despite its many infuriating flaws -- not the least of which is Amy's self-absorbed personality -- Amy's O's honesty will win you over .
__label__neutral	Despite its title , Amy's Orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one .
__label__positive	Despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy .
__label__negative	Despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style .
__label__negative	Despite the premise of a good story ... it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles .
__label__very_positive	Despite what anyone believes about the goal of its makers , the show ... represents a spectacular piece of theater , and there's no denying the talent of the creative forces behind it .
__label__negative	Dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter .
__label__very_positive	Diane Lane shines in Unfaithful .
__label__positive	Digital-video documentary about stand-up comedians is a great glimpse into a very different world .
__label__neutral	Director Barry Skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of `` The Longest Yard '' playbook like a checklist .
__label__very_positive	Director Benoit Jacquot , making his first opera-to-film translation with Tosca , conveys the heaving passion of Puccini's famous love-jealousy - murder-suicide fandango with great cinematic innovation .
__label__negative	Director Brian Levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you'll find on a French poodle .
__label__neutral	Director Clare Kilner's debut is never as daft as it should have been .
__label__negative	Director Dirk Shafer and co-writer Greg Hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama .
__label__positive	Director Ferzan Ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building .
__label__positive	Director Kapur is a filmmaker with a real flair for epic landscapes and adventure , and this is a better film than his earlier English-language movie , the overpraised Elizabeth .
__label__negative	Director Nalin Pan doesn't do much to weigh any arguments one way or the other .
__label__positive	Director Rob Marshall went out gunning to make a great one .
__label__very_positive	Disney's live-action division has a history of releasing cinematic flotsam , but this is one occasion when they have unearthed a rare gem .
__label__neutral	Disney has always been hit-or-miss when bringing beloved kids ' books to the screen ... Tuck Everlasting is a little of both .
__label__neutral	Dissing a Bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick .
__label__very_positive	Disturbing and brilliant documentary .
__label__very_negative	Disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material .
__label__negative	Divertingly ridiculous , headbangingly noisy .
__label__very_positive	Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood may not be exactly divine , but it's definitely -- defiantly -- ya ya , what with all of those terrific songs and spirited performances .
__label__very_negative	Don't expect any surprises in this checklist of teamwork cliches ...
__label__negative	Don't let your festive spirit go this far .
__label__positive	Don't plan on the perfect ending , but Sweet Home Alabama hits the mark with critics who escaped from a small town life .
__label__very_negative	Don't waste your money .
__label__very_negative	Do not , under any circumstances , consider taking a child younger than middle school age to this wallow in crude humor .
__label__very_negative	Do we really need a 77-minute film to tell us exactly why a romantic relationship between a 15-year-old boy and a 40-year-old woman doesn't work ?
__label__negative	Doesn't amount to much of anything .
__label__very_positive	Does what a fine documentary does best : It extends a warm invitation into an unfamiliar world , then illuminates it fully and allows the larger implications of the journey to sink in unobtrusively .
__label__very_positive	Dolgin and Franco fashion a fascinating portrait of a Vietnamese-born youngster who eagerly and easily assimilated as an all-American girl with a brand new name in southern Tennessee .
__label__very_positive	Doug Liman , the director of Bourne , directs the traffic well , gets a nice wintry look from his locations , absorbs us with the movie's spycraft and uses Damon's ability to be focused and sincere .
__label__negative	Drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the - past numbness .
__label__negative	Dreary , highly annoying ... ` Some Body ' will appeal to No One .
__label__neutral	Drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that Three Seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality .
__label__positive	Droll caper-comedy remake of `` Big Deal on Madonna Street '' that's a sly , amusing , laugh-filled little gem in which the ultimate `` Bellini '' begins to look like a `` real Kaputschnik . ''
__label__negative	Dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm .
__label__neutral	Each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , Storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception .
__label__negative	Earnest but earthbound ... a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama\/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast .
__label__negative	Earnest falls short of its Ideal predecessor largely due to Parker's ill-advised meddling with the timeless source material .
__label__positive	Earns its laughs from stock redneck ` types ' and from the many , many moments when we recognize even without the Elizabethan prose , the play behind the thing .
__label__neutral	Easier to respect than enthuse over , Andersson's rigorous personal vision is not only distanced but distancing .
__label__very_positive	Eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work .
__label__very_negative	Ecks this one off your must-see list .
__label__positive	Edited and shot with a syncopated style mimicking the work of his subjects , Pray turns the idea of the documentary on its head , making it rousing , invigorating fun lacking any MTV puffery .
__label__neutral	Effective but too-tepid biopic
__label__very_positive	Effectively feeds our senses with the chilling sights and sounds from within the camp to create a completely numbing experience .
__label__negative	Egoyan's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious .
__label__very_positive	Eight Crazy Nights is a showcase for Sandler's many talents .
__label__neutral	Elicits more groans from the audience than Jar Jar Binks , Scrappy Doo and Scooby Dumb , all wrapped up into one .
__label__positive	Elling , portrayed with quiet fastidiousness by Per Christian Ellefsen , is a truly singular character , one whose frailties are only slightly magnified versions of the ones that vex nearly everyone .
__label__positive	Elling really is about a couple of crazy guys , and it's therapeutic to laugh along with them .
__label__very_positive	Emerges as something rare , an issue movie that's so honest and keenly observed that it doesn't feel like one .
__label__neutral	Enduring love but exhausting cinema .
__label__very_positive	Energetic and boldly provocative .
__label__very_positive	Engagingly captures the maddening and magnetic ebb and flow of friendship .
__label__neutral	Engrossing and affecting , if ultimately not quite satisfying .
__label__neutral	Enjoy it for what it is ; you can hate yourself later .
__label__positive	Enormously likable , partly because it is aware of its own grasp of the absurd .
__label__negative	Enough similarities to Gymkata and Howie Long's Firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs .
__label__very_negative	Enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment .
__label__neutral	Equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama .
__label__positive	Escapism in its purest form .
__label__negative	Ethan Hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the Beatnik generation and it's all over his Chelsea Walls .
__label__negative	Even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame .
__label__very_negative	Even by dumb action-movie standards , Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever is a dumb action movie .
__label__very_negative	Even die-hard fans of Japanese animation ... will find this one a challenge .
__label__negative	Even if Britney Spears is really cute , her movie is really bad .
__label__neutral	Even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission's worth of funny to keep it afloat .
__label__neutral	Even if the ride's a little bumpy , with a final lap that's all too suspiciously smooth , you gotta give director Roger Michell , best known for the superfluous Notting Hill , credit for trying .
__label__positive	Even if you can't pronounce `` gyro '' correctly , you'll appreciate much of Vardalos ' humor , which transcends ethnic boundaries .
__label__neutral	Even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to Belushi's easy-going likableness .
__label__negative	Even legends like Alfred Hitchcock and John Huston occasionally directed trifles ... so it's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like Zhang Yimou behind the camera for a yarn that's ultimately rather inconsequential .
__label__negative	Even the imaginative gore can't hide the musty scent of Todd Farmer's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 Alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship .
__label__very_negative	Even the unwatchable Soapdish is more original .
__label__negative	Even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy ... even for Disney .
__label__neutral	Even those who would like to dismiss the film outright should find much to mull and debate .
__label__positive	Even when foreign directors ... borrow stuff from Hollywood , they invariably shake up the formula and make it more interesting .
__label__very_positive	Even with all those rough edges safely sanded down , the American Insomnia is still pretty darned good .
__label__positive	Eventually , it wins you over .
__label__very_negative	Every bit as bogus as most Disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point .
__label__neutral	Every good actor needs to do his or her own Hamlet .
__label__neutral	Every so often a movie comes along that confirms one's worse fears about civilization as we know it .
__label__negative	Everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones .
__label__neutral	Everything that's worthwhile about Collision Course can already be seen on television .
__label__very_positive	Everything that has to do with Yvan and Charlotte , and everything that has to do with Yvan's rambunctious , Jewish sister and her non-Jew husband , feels funny and true .
__label__very_positive	Everything you loved about it in 1982 is still there , for everybody who wants to be a kid again , or show it to their own kids .
__label__positive	Everytime you think Undercover Brother has run out of steam , it finds a new way to surprise and amuse .
__label__very_positive	Everywhere the camera looks there is something worth seeing .
__label__positive	Evokes a little of the fear that parents have for the possible futures of their children -- and the sometimes bad choices mothers and fathers make in the interests of doing them good .
__label__very_positive	Excellent acting and direction .
__label__negative	Expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially Seven , which director William Malone slavishly copies .
__label__negative	Extreme Oops - oops , ops , no matter how you spell it , it's still a mistake to go see it .
__label__very_negative	Extremely boring .
__label__negative	Extremely confusing .
__label__very_negative	Extremely dumb .
__label__negative	Fails to bring as much to the table .
__label__negative	Fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters .
__label__negative	Falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that aren't funny .
__label__very_positive	Fans of Behan's work and of Irish movies in general will be rewarded by Borstal Boy .
__label__positive	Fans of Nijinsky will savor every minute of Cox's work .
__label__neutral	Fans of the TV series will be disappointed , and everyone else will be slightly bored .
__label__positive	Fans of the animated wildlife adventure show will be in warthog heaven ; others need not necessarily apply .
__label__positive	Far from perfect , but its heart is in the right place ... innocent and well-meaning .
__label__positive	Farrell ... thankfully manages to outshine the role and successfully plays the foil to Willis's world-weary colonel .
__label__neutral	Faultlessly professional but finally slight .
__label__negative	Feel bad for King , who's honestly trying , and Schwartzman , who's shot himself in the foot .
__label__negative	Feels less like it's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers .
__label__very_negative	Feels like one of those contrived , only-in - Hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating Oscar talk .
__label__negative	Feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention .
__label__neutral	Feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the Lifetime cable television network .
__label__neutral	Ferrara directs the entire film with the kind of detachment that makes any given frame look like a family's custom-made Christmas card .
__label__very_positive	Few films this year have been as resolute in their emotional nakedness .
__label__very_negative	Filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low .
__label__positive	Finally , a genre movie that delivers -- in a couple of genres , no less .
__label__very_positive	Finds a way to tell a simple story , perhaps the simplest story of all , in a way that seems compelling and even original .
__label__negative	Fine acting but there is no sense of connecting the dots , just dots .
__label__negative	First good , then bothersome .
__label__positive	Fisher has bared his soul and confronted his own shortcomings here in a way ... that feels very human and very true to life .
__label__very_negative	Flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey .
__label__negative	Flashy , pretentious and as impenetrable as Morvern's thick , working-class Scottish accent .
__label__negative	Flat , but with a revelatory performance by Michelle Williams .
__label__negative	Flaunts its quirky excesses like a New Year's Eve drunk sporting a paper party hat .
__label__positive	Flavorful and romantic , you could call this How Martha Got Her Groove Back -- assuming , that is , she ever had one to begin with .
__label__neutral	Flawed but worthy look at life in U.S. relocation camps .
__label__negative	Flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising .
__label__negative	Flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind .
__label__positive	For Benigni it wasn't Shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but Pinocchio .
__label__negative	For Caine Lovers only .
__label__negative	For a film about two mismatched buddies , Crystal and De Niro share little screen time and even less chemistry .
__label__positive	For a good chunk of its running time , Trapped is an effective and claustrophobic thriller .
__label__negative	For a shoot - 'em - up , Ballistic is oddly lifeless .
__label__negative	For all its alleged youthful fire , XXX is no less subservient to Bond's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero .
__label__positive	For all its failed connections , Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood is nurturing , in a gauzy , dithering way .
__label__negative	For all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale .
__label__negative	For all its surface frenzy , High Crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer .
__label__neutral	For all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that Kapur tries to bring to The Four Feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear .
__label__very_negative	For anyone who grew up on Disney's 1950 Treasure Island , or remembers the 1934 Victor Fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor .
__label__very_positive	For anyone who remembers the '60s or is interested in one man's response to stroke , Ram Dass : Fierce Grace is worth seeking out .
__label__very_positive	For its seriousness , high literary aspirations and stunning acting , the film can only be applauded .
__label__very_negative	For me , this opera isn't a favorite , so it's a long time before the fat lady sings .
__label__positive	For the first time in several years , Mr. Allen has surpassed himself with the magic he's spun with the Hollywood empress of Ms. Leoni's Ellie .
__label__positive	For the first two-thirds of this sparklingly inventive and artful , always fast and furious tale , kids will go happily along for the ride .
__label__positive	For the most part , I Spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of Murphy's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies .
__label__neutral	For the most part , the ingredients are there .
__label__very_positive	Ford deserves to be remembered at Oscar time for crafting this wonderful portrait of a conflicted soldier .
__label__very_negative	Formula 51 is so trite that even Yu's high-energy action stylings can't break through the stupor .
__label__very_negative	Fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water .
__label__positive	Foster nails the role , giving a tight , focused performance illuminated by shards of feeling .
__label__neutral	Frailty isn't as gory or explicit .
__label__negative	Francophiles will snicker knowingly and you'll want to slap them .
__label__negative	Frenetic but not really funny .
__label__very_positive	Frida's artistic brilliance is undeniable -- it's among the most breathtakingly designed films I've ever seen .
__label__negative	Friday After Next has the same problem that Next Friday did -- it's called Where's Chris Tucker When You Need Him ?
__label__positive	From spiritual rebirth to bruising defeat , Vincent's odyssey resonates in a profound way , comparable to the classic films of Jean Renoir .
__label__positive	From the big giant titles of the opening credits to Elmer Bernstein's perfectly melodic score , Haynes gets just about everything right .
__label__negative	Frustratingly , Dridi tells us nothing about El Gallo other than what emerges through his music .
__label__very_positive	Full Frontal is the antidote for Soderbergh fans who think he's gone too commercial since his two Oscar nominated films in 2000
__label__very_positive	Full of profound , real-life moments that anyone can relate to , it deserves a wide audience .
__label__very_positive	Fuller would surely have called this gutsy and at times exhilarating movie a great yarn .
__label__positive	Funny and , at times , poignant , the film from director George Hickenlooper all takes place in Pasadena , `` a city where people still read . ''
__label__very_negative	Gangs of New York is an unapologetic mess , whose only saving grace is that it ends by blowing just about everything up .
__label__negative	Gee , a second assassin shot Kennedy ?
__label__very_positive	Genuinely touching because it's realistic about all kinds of love .
__label__negative	George , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please .
__label__positive	George Clooney proves he's quite a talented director and Sam Rockwell shows us he's a world-class actor with Confessions of a Dangerous Mind .
__label__positive	Gets under the skin of a man who has just lost his wife .
__label__neutral	Girls gone wild and gone civil again
__label__negative	Given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there isn't much .
__label__negative	Glib , satirical documentary that fudges facts , makes facile points and engages in the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism .
__label__positive	Gloriously goofy -LRB- and gory -RRB- midnight movie stuff .
__label__very_positive	Go see it and enjoy .
__label__negative	God help the poor woman if Attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional Yvan's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse .
__label__very_negative	Godawful boring slug of a movie .
__label__very_positive	Gollum's ` performance ' is incredible !
__label__very_positive	Good actress .
__label__negative	Good for a few unintentional laughs , `` Extreme Ops '' was obviously made for the `` XXX '' crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction .
__label__very_positive	Good movie .
__label__positive	Good ol' urban legend stuff .
__label__very_positive	Gosling provides an amazing performance that dwarfs everything else in the film .
__label__very_positive	Goyer's screenplay and direction are thankfully understated , and he has drawn excellent performances from his cast .
__label__positive	Grant gets to display his cadness to perfection , but also to show acting range that may surprise some who thought light-hearted comedy was his forte .
__label__neutral	Great story , bad idea for a movie .
__label__very_positive	Greene delivers a typically solid performance in a role that is a bit of a departure from the noble characters he has played in the past , and he is matched by Schweig , who carries the film on his broad , handsome shoulders .
__label__very_positive	Greengrass has delivered an undoubted stylistic tour-de-force , and has managed elements such as sound and cinematography with skill
__label__very_positive	Guaranteed to move anyone who ever shook , rattled , or rolled .
__label__very_negative	Guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens .
__label__negative	Guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things .
__label__very_negative	Had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago .
__label__neutral	Had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin .
__label__negative	Half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder ... would be more at home on a daytime television serial .
__label__very_positive	Hands down the year's most thought-provoking film .
__label__positive	Haneke challenges us to confront the reality of sexual aberration .
__label__neutral	Haneke keeps us at arm's length .
__label__positive	Happily for Mr. Chin -- though unhappily for his subjects -- the invisible hand of the marketplace wrote a script that no human screenwriter could have hoped to match .
__label__neutral	Hardly makes the kind of points Egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world .
__label__positive	Harsh , effective documentary on life in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories .
__label__positive	Has a shambling charm ... a cheerfully inconsequential diversion .
__label__neutral	Has all the poignancy of a Hallmark card and all the comedy of a Gallagher stand-up act .
__label__negative	Has it ever been possible to say that Williams has truly inhabited a character ?
__label__negative	Has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags .
__label__neutral	Has something to say ... but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller .
__label__negative	Has the feel of an unedited personal journal .
__label__very_positive	Having never been a huge fan of Dickens ' 800-page novel , it surprised me how much pleasure I had watching McGrath's version .
__label__very_positive	Hawke draws out the best from his large cast in beautifully articulated portrayals that are subtle and so expressive they can sustain the poetic flights in Burdette's dialogue .
__label__positive	Hayek is stunning as Frida and ... a star-making project .
__label__neutral	Haynes has so fanatically fetishized every bizarre old-movie idiosyncrasy with such monastic devotion you're not sure if you should applaud or look into having him committed .
__label__negative	He'd create a movie better than this .
__label__positive	He's Super Spy !
__label__neutral	He can scale a building like a super hero , he can out-stealth any agent , he'll get the girl .
__label__very_negative	He has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about .
__label__positive	He just wants them to be part of the action , the wallpaper of his chosen reality .
__label__positive	He simply presents his point of view that Ayurveda works .
__label__neutral	Heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension .
__label__negative	Helmer DeVito ... attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids ' TV and revenge .
__label__very_positive	Her delivery and timing are flawless .
__label__very_negative	Her film is unrelentingly claustrophobic and unpleasant .
__label__positive	Here's a British flick gleefully unconcerned with plausibility , yet just as determined to entertain you .
__label__negative	Here's a self-congratulatory 3D IMAX rah-rah .
__label__positive	Here , Adrian Lyne comes as close to profundity as he is likely to get .
__label__neutral	Here , thankfully , they are .
__label__negative	Herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among Germany and Eastern European Jews might have changed 20th-Century history is undermined by Ahola's inadequate performance .
__label__neutral	Hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it's heading .
__label__negative	Hey , who else needs a shower ?
__label__negative	High Crimes miscasts nearly every leading character .
__label__neutral	High on melodrama .
__label__positive	Highlights are the terrific performances by Christopher Plummer , as the prime villain , and Nathan Lane as Vincent Crummles , the eccentric theater company manager .
__label__very_positive	Hilarious , acidic Brit comedy .
__label__very_positive	Hilarious , touching and wonderfully dyspeptic .
__label__neutral	Hip-hop has a history , and it's a metaphor for this love story .
__label__very_positive	His characters are engaging , intimate and the dialogue is realistic and greatly moving .
__label__neutral	His warriors collide in balletic explosion that implies an underlying order throughout the chaos .
__label__neutral	Hits one out of the park for the ` they don't make 'em like that anymore ' department .
__label__neutral	Hmm .
__label__negative	Home Alone goes Hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even Steven Spielberg would know how to do .
__label__neutral	Hopkins .
__label__neutral	How anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us .
__label__very_negative	How did it ever get made ?
__label__very_negative	How on earth , or anywhere else , did director Ron Underwood manage to blow $ 100 million on this ?
__label__negative	However , it lacks grandeur and that epic quality often associated with Stevenson's tale as well as with earlier Disney efforts .
__label__neutral	However clever Nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release .
__label__very_positive	Hu and Liu offer natural , matter-of-fact performances that glint with sorrow , longing and love .
__label__very_positive	Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock are two such likeable actors .
__label__neutral	Human Nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control .
__label__negative	Human Nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal .
__label__neutral	Human Resources was a good , straightforward tale , but Time Out is better .
__label__very_positive	Huppert gives Erika a persona that is so intriguing that you find yourself staring hypnotically at her , trying to understand her and wondering if she'll crack .
__label__negative	I'd give real money to see the perpetrators of Chicago torn apart by dingoes .
__label__neutral	I'm afraid you won't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers B-flick with just a suspension of disbelief .
__label__negative	I'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you're the kind of person who has seen every Wim Wenders film of the '70s .
__label__neutral	I've heard that the fans of the first Men in Black have come away hating the second one .
__label__very_negative	I Spy is an embarrassment , a monotonous , disjointed jumble of borrowed plot points and situations .
__label__positive	I admired it , particularly that unexpected downer of an ending .
__label__very_positive	I admired this work a lot .
__label__neutral	I believe the message is in the messenger : The agent is a woman .
__label__negative	I can only imagine one thing worse than Kevin Spacey trying on an Irish accent , and that's sultry Linda Fiorentino doing the same thing .
__label__very_positive	I complain all the time about seeing the same ideas repeated in films over and over again , but The Bourne Identity proves that a fresh take is always possible .
__label__very_negative	I cry for I Spy -- or I would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-TV spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind .
__label__negative	I didn't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot .
__label__negative	I didn't laugh at the ongoing efforts of Cube , and his skinny buddy Mike Epps , to make like Laurel and Hardy 'n the hood .
__label__negative	I don't have an I Am Sam clue .
__label__positive	I don't know precisely what to make of Steven Soderbergh's Full Frontal , though that didn't stop me from enjoying much of it .
__label__positive	I don't think I've been as entranced and appalled by an Asian film since Shinya Tsukamoto's Iron Man .
__label__negative	I doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time Christmas really rolls around , but maybe it'll be on video by then .
__label__neutral	I enjoyed Time of Favor while I was watching it , but I was surprised at how quickly it faded from my memory .
__label__very_negative	I found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic .
__label__negative	I hate this movie
__label__very_negative	I hated every minute of it .
__label__neutral	I haven't seen one in so long , no wonder I didn't recognize it at first .
__label__negative	I just didn't care as much for the story .
__label__negative	I kept thinking over and over again , ' I should be enjoying this . '
__label__negative	I kept wishing I was watching a documentary about the wartime Navajos and what they accomplished instead of all this specious Hollywood hoo-ha .
__label__positive	I like Frank the Pug , though .
__label__very_positive	I like the new footage and still love the old stuff .
__label__very_positive	I love the way that it took chances and really asks you to take these great leaps of faith and pays off .
__label__very_positive	I loved it !
__label__positive	I loved looking at this movie .
__label__negative	I regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough .
__label__negative	I saw Knockaround Guys yesterday , and already the details have faded like photographs from the Spanish-American War ... It's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink .
__label__negative	I tried to read the time on my watch .
__label__negative	I was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness .
__label__very_negative	I watched the brainless insanity of No Such Thing with mounting disbelief .
__label__negative	I weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider Blue Crush to be an intelligent film about young women .
__label__very_positive	I whole-heartedly recommend that everyone see this movie -- for its historical significance alone .
__label__very_negative	I wish I could say `` Thank God It's Friday '' , but the truth of the matter is I was glad when it was over .
__label__neutral	I wonder what the reaction of Israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation .
__label__neutral	I wonder why .
__label__negative	I would have preferred a transfer down the hall to Mr. Holland's class for the music , or to Robin Williams's lecture so I could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve .
__label__negative	IHOPs don't pile on this much syrup .
__label__very_positive	Ice Cube holds the film together with an engaging and warm performance ...
__label__very_negative	If High Crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title .
__label__negative	If Kaufman kept Cameron Diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he'd have them mate .
__label__very_negative	If Melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna .
__label__negative	If Myers decides to make another Austin Powers movie , maybe he should just stick with Austin and Dr Evil .
__label__very_negative	If Shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why didn't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ?
__label__neutral	If it's another regurgitated action movie you're after , there's no better film than Half Past Dead .
__label__very_positive	If it's possible for a sequel to outshine the original , then SL2 does just that .
__label__very_positive	If it seems like a minor miracle that its septuagenarian star is young enough to be the nonagenarian filmmaker's son , more incredible still are the clear-eyed boldness and quiet irony with which actor and director take on life's urgent questions .
__label__positive	If it tried to do anything more , it would fail and perhaps explode , but at this level of manic whimsy , it is just about right .
__label__very_positive	If no one singles out any of these performances as award-worthy , it's only because we would expect nothing less from this bunch .
__label__positive	If nothing else , this movie introduces a promising , unusual kind of psychological horror .
__label__negative	If somebody was bored and ... decided to make a dull , pretentious version of Jesus ' Son , they'd come up with something like Bart Freundlich's World Traveler .
__label__neutral	If the ' 70's were your idea of a good time at the movies , this will make you very happy .
__label__neutral	If the message seems more facile than the earlier films , the images have such a terrible beauty you may not care .
__label__neutral	If there's a way to effectively teach kids about the dangers of drugs , I think it's in projects like the -LRB- unfortunately R-rated -RRB- Paid .
__label__neutral	If there's nothing fresh about Wannabes , which was written by Mr. DeMeo , who produced and directed the film with Charles A. Addessi , much of the time the movie feels authentic .
__label__negative	If this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called The Hills Have Antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins .
__label__negative	If this is an example of the type of project that Robert Redford's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it's time to rethink independent films .
__label__negative	If this is satire , it's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook .
__label__very_negative	If this is the Danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps .
__label__very_negative	If this is the resurrection of the Halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead .
__label__neutral	If this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called Beta Alpha Delta .
__label__very_positive	If this movie were a book , it would be a page-turner , you can't wait to see what happens next .
__label__negative	If we don't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get .
__label__very_positive	If you're like me , a sucker for a good old fashion romance and someone who shamelessly loves to eat , then Mostly Martha offers all the perfect ingredients to more than satisfy your appetite .
__label__very_negative	If you're looking for comedy to be served up , better look elsewhere .
__label__negative	If you're not a prepubescent girl , you'll be laughing at Britney Spears ' movie-starring debut whenever it doesn't have you impatiently squinting at your watch .
__label__very_negative	If you're not into the Pokemon franchise , this fourth animated movie in four years won't convert you -- or even keep your eyes open .
__label__negative	If you're not the target demographic ... this movie is one long chick-flick slog .
__label__positive	If you can get past the fantastical aspects and harsh realities of `` The Isle '' you'll get a sock-you-in-the-eye flick that is a visual tour-de-force and a story that is unlike any you will likely see anywhere else .
__label__negative	If you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still wouldn't add up to the time required to boil a four - minute egg .
__label__very_positive	If you liked such movies as Notting Hill , Four Weddings And A Funeral , Bridget Jones ' Diary or High Fidelity , then you won't want to miss About A Boy .
__label__very_positive	If you liked the 1982 film then , you'll still like it now .
__label__very_positive	If you love Motown music , you'll love this documentary .
__label__negative	If you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce .
__label__positive	If you sometimes like to go to the movies to have fun , Wasabi is a good place to start .
__label__negative	If you think that Jennifer Lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry Ben Affleck , wait till you see Maid in Manhattan .
__label__positive	If your senses haven't been dulled by slasher films and gorefests , if you're a connoisseur of psychological horror , this is your ticket .
__label__neutral	Illuminating if overly talky documentary .
__label__very_negative	Imagine a really bad community theater production of West Side Story without the songs .
__label__negative	Imagine if you will a Tony Hawk skating video interspliced with footage from Behind Enemy Lines and set to Jersey shore techno .
__label__negative	Imagine the James Woods character from Videodrome making a home movie of Audrey Rose and showing it to the kid from The Sixth Sense and you've imagined The Ring .
__label__neutral	Immediately .
__label__very_positive	Impresses you with its open-endedness and surprises .
__label__positive	In Adobo , ethnicity is not just the spice , but at the heart of more universal concerns .
__label__positive	In Fessenden's horror trilogy , this theme has proved important to him and is especially so in the finale .
__label__very_negative	In a normal screen process , these bromides would be barely enough to sustain an interstitial program on the Discovery Channel .
__label__neutral	In a word -- yes .
__label__very_positive	In his debut as a film director , Denzel Washington delivers a lean and engaging work .
__label__positive	In its ragged , cheap and unassuming way , the movie works .
__label__very_positive	In scope , ambition and accomplishment , Children of the Century ... takes Kurys ' career to a whole new level .
__label__negative	In the end , Punch-Drunk Love is one of those films that I wanted to like much more than I actually did .
__label__neutral	In the end , Ted Bundy's only justification is the director's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there's no larger point , and little social context .
__label__neutral	In the end , White Oleander isn't an adaptation of a novel .
__label__positive	In the process , they demonstrate that there's still a lot of life in Hong Kong cinema .
__label__negative	In the second half of the film , Frei's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives Nachtwey for self-analysis .
__label__neutral	Insomnia is involving .
__label__negative	Instead , we just get messy anger , a movie as personal therapy .
__label__negative	Instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film's more determined to become the next Texas Chainsaw Massacre .
__label__negative	Instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , Hart's War , like the St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl , waits until after halftime to get started .
__label__negative	Intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area .
__label__positive	Interacting eyeball-to-eyeball and toe-to-toe , Hopkins and Norton are a winning combination -- but Fiennes steals ` Red Dragon ' right from under their noses .
__label__positive	Intriguing and beautiful film , but those of you who read the book are likely to be disappointed .
__label__very_positive	Invincible is a wonderful movie .
__label__negative	Involving at times , but lapses quite casually into the absurd .
__label__neutral	Is it a total success ?
__label__neutral	Is it something any true film addict will want to check out ?
__label__positive	Isn't it great ?
__label__positive	Isn't quite the equal of Woo's best earlier work , but it's easily his finest American film ... comes close to recapturing the brilliance of his Hong Kong films .
__label__neutral	Is office work really as alienating as ` Bartleby ' so effectively makes it ?
__label__neutral	Is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of Wilco's last album ?
__label__negative	Is this progress ?
__label__neutral	It's a Count for our times .
__label__very_positive	It's a beautifully accomplished lyrical meditation on a bunch of despondent and vulnerable characters living in the renown Chelsea Hotel ...
__label__positive	It's a bittersweet and lyrical mix of elements .
__label__very_positive	It's a brave attempt to tap into the heartbeat of the world , a salute to the universal language of rhythm and a zippy sampling of sounds .
__label__positive	It's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it doesn't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor .
__label__neutral	It's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story .
__label__negative	It's a film that hinges on its casting , and Glover really doesn't fit the part .
__label__neutral	It's a flashy , star-splashed reduction .
__label__very_positive	It's a glorious groove that leaves you wanting more .
__label__very_positive	It's a good film -- not a classic , but odd , entertaining and authentic .
__label__negative	It's a great deal of sizzle and very little steak .
__label__positive	It's a hoot and a half , and a great way for the American people to see what a candidate is like when he's not giving the same 15-cent stump speech .
__label__positive	It's a humble effort , but spiced with wry humor and genuine pathos , especially between Morgan and Redgrave .
__label__positive	It's a minor comedy that tries to balance sweetness with coarseness , while it paints a sad picture of the singles scene .
__label__very_positive	It's a movie -- and an album -- you won't want to miss .
__label__negative	It's a movie forged in the fires of Chick Flick Hell .
__label__positive	It's a nicely detailed world of pawns , bishops and kings , of wagers in dingy backrooms or pristine forests .
__label__very_positive	It's a pleasure to see Seinfeld griping about the biz with buddies Chris Rock , Garry Shandling and Colin Quinn .
__label__positive	It's a refreshing change from the self-interest and paranoia that shape most American representations of Castro .
__label__positive	It's a sly wink to The Others without becoming a postmodern joke , made creepy by its `` men in a sardine can '' warped logic .
__label__neutral	It's a sometimes interesting remake that doesn't compare to the brilliant original .
__label__very_positive	It's a terrific American sports movie and Dennis Quaid is its athletic heart .
__label__neutral	It's a trifle .
__label__neutral	It's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition .
__label__positive	It's absolutely spooky how Lillard channels the Shagster right down to the original Casey Kasem-furnished voice .
__label__negative	It's all pretty cynical and condescending , too .
__label__positive	It's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you're more than six years old .
__label__very_positive	It's almost impossible not to be moved by the movie's depiction of sacrifice and its stirring epilogue in post-Soviet Russia .
__label__neutral	It's also clear from the start that The Transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film's shortcomings start to shine through .
__label__negative	It's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views .
__label__negative	It's also stupider .
__label__very_positive	It's also the year's sweetest movie .
__label__very_positive	It's amazingly perceptive in its subtle , supportive but unsentimental look at the Marks family .
__label__very_negative	It's an awfully derivative story .
__label__neutral	It's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances , but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable .
__label__positive	It's an example of sophisticated , challenging filmmaking that stands , despite its noticeable lack of emotional heft , in welcome contrast to the indulgent dead-end experimentation of the director's previous Full Frontal .
__label__positive	It's an old story , but a lively script , sharp acting and partially animated interludes make Just a Kiss seem minty fresh .
__label__very_positive	It's as close as we'll ever come to looking through a photographer's viewfinder as he works .
__label__negative	It's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun .
__label__positive	It's astonishing .
__label__very_negative	It's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school .
__label__negative	It's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit Cherish .
__label__positive	It's both a necessary political work and a fascinating documentary ...
__label__very_negative	It's difficult to say whether The Tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing -- I'm prepared to call it a draw .
__label__negative	It's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few big-name actors and cameos at a hokey script .
__label__very_negative	It's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff .
__label__positive	It's endearing to hear Madame D. refer to her husband as ` Jackie ' -- and he does make for excellent company , not least as a self-conscious performer .
__label__negative	It's fairly self-aware in its dumbness .
__label__negative	It's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high .
__label__neutral	It's fun , but a psychological mess , with Austin Powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet .
__label__neutral	It's fun , but the code-talk will fly right over everyone's head
__label__negative	It's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that Hollywood isn't laughing with us , folks .
__label__neutral	It's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile .
__label__very_negative	It's hard not to feel you've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story .
__label__negative	It's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins .
__label__neutral	It's haunting .
__label__negative	It's just a silly black genre spoof .
__label__very_negative	It's just incredibly dull .
__label__negative	It's laughing at us .
__label__positive	It's like a poem .
__label__very_negative	It's neither as romantic nor as thrilling as it should be .
__label__very_negative	It's never a good sign when a film's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma .
__label__positive	It's not exactly a gourmet meal but the fare is fair , even coming from the drive-thru .
__label__very_negative	It's not horrible , just horribly mediocre .
__label__positive	It's not so much enjoyable to watch as it is enlightening to listen to new sides of a previous reality , and to visit with some of the people who were able to make an impact in the theater world .
__label__neutral	It's not that Waiting For Happiness is a bad film , because it isn't .
__label__neutral	It's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie .
__label__very_positive	It's obviously struck a responsive chord with many South Koreans , and should work its magic in other parts of the world .
__label__negative	It's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold .
__label__neutral	It's often infuriatingly glib and posturing , and yet it has been made with great evident care and manages to deliver up the man in a way to arouse further curiosity in even the most unknowing viewer .
__label__very_positive	It's one of the most honest films ever made about Hollywood .
__label__very_positive	It's one of the saddest films I have ever seen that still manages to be uplifting but not overly sentimental .
__label__very_negative	It's painful .
__label__positive	It's predictable , but it jumps through the expected hoops with style and even some depth .
__label__negative	It's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people who can't come up with legitimate funny , and it's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed .
__label__very_positive	It's rare to find a film that dazzles the eye , challenges the brain , AND satisfies our lust for fast-paced action , but Minority Report delivers all that and a whole lot more .
__label__positive	It's rather like a Lifetime special -- pleasant , sweet and forgettable .
__label__negative	It's really yet another anemic and formulaic Lethal Weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness .
__label__very_negative	It's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic Oliver Parker intends to mangle next time .
__label__negative	It's so underwritten that you can't figure out just where the other characters , including Ana's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of Ana's future .
__label__very_positive	It's solid and affecting and exactly as thought-provoking as it should be .
__label__positive	It's still worth a look .
__label__very_positive	It's the best film of the year so far , the benchmark against which all other Best Picture contenders should be measured .
__label__positive	It's the cinematic equivalent of a good page-turner , and even if it's nonsense , its claws dig surprisingly deep .
__label__negative	It's the kind of movie you can't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you can't bring yourself to dislike it .
__label__positive	It's the kind of pigeonhole-resisting romp that Hollywood too rarely provides .
__label__neutral	It's this memory-as-identity obviation that gives Secret Life its intermittent unease , reaffirming that long-held illusions are indeed reality , and that erasing them recasts the self .
__label__neutral	It's too long , too repetitive , and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner .
__label__neutral	It's tough , astringent , darkly funny and ... well , it's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning .
__label__very_positive	It's traditional moviemaking all the way , but it's done with a lot of careful period attention as well as some very welcome wit .
__label__positive	It almost plays like Solaris , but with guns and jokes .
__label__negative	It becomes gimmicky instead of compelling .
__label__very_positive	It could change America , not only because it is full of necessary discussion points , but because it is so accessible that it makes complex politics understandable to viewers looking for nothing but energetic entertainment .
__label__positive	It dares to be a little different , and that shading is what makes it worthwhile .
__label__negative	It delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for Deeper Meaning .
__label__negative	It doesn't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality .
__label__very_negative	It doesn't help that the director and cinematographer Stephen Kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel .
__label__neutral	It doesn't quite deserve the gong , but there are more fascinating acts than `` Confessions of a Dangerous Mind . ''
__label__neutral	It doesn't quite work , but there's enough here to make us look forward to the Russos ' next offering .
__label__positive	It does succeed by following a feel-good formula with a winning style , and by offering its target audience of urban kids some welcome role models and optimism .
__label__positive	It extends the writings of Jean Genet and John Rechy , the films of Fassbinder , perhaps even the nocturnal works of Goya .
__label__very_negative	It feels like a community theater production of a great Broadway play : Even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original .
__label__very_positive	It further declares its director , Zhang Yang of Shower , as a boldly experimental , contemporary stylist with a bright future .
__label__neutral	It has a subtle way of getting under your skin and sticking with you long after it's over .
__label__positive	It has fun being grown up .
__label__very_positive	It has the courage to wonder about big questions with sincerity and devotion .
__label__positive	It helps that Lil Bow Wow ... tones down his pint-sized gangsta act to play someone who resembles a real kid .
__label__positive	It helps that the central performers are experienced actors , and that they know their roles so well .
__label__neutral	It is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie ... but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made Eurotrash cult object .
__label__positive	It is a film that will have people walking out halfway through , will encourage others to stand up and applaud , and will , undoubtedly , leave both camps engaged in a ferocious debate for years to come .
__label__very_positive	It is a kickass , dense sci-fi action thriller hybrid that delivers and then some .
__label__positive	It is also , at times , curiously moving .
__label__positive	It is far from the worst , thanks to the topical issues it raises , the performances of Stewart and Hardy , and that essential feature -- a decent full-on space battle .
__label__very_positive	It is inspirational in characterizing how people from such diverse cultures share the same human and spiritual needs .
__label__very_positive	It is intensely personal and yet -- unlike Quills -- deftly shows us the temper of the times .
__label__positive	It is interesting and fun to see Goodall and her chimpanzees on the bigger-than-life screen .
__label__neutral	It is nature against progress .
__label__positive	It is not a mass-market entertainment but an uncompromising attempt by one artist to think about another .
__label__neutral	It is now .
__label__positive	It is ridiculous , of course ... but it is also refreshing , disarming , and just outright enjoyable despite its ridiculousness .
__label__very_positive	It is risky , intelligent , romantic and rapturous from start to finish .
__label__positive	It is so refreshing to see Robin Williams turn 180 degrees from the string of insultingly innocuous and sappy fiascoes he's been making for the last several years .
__label__neutral	It may be a prize winner , but Teacher is a bomb .
__label__negative	It may be an easy swipe to take , but this Barbershop just doesn't make the cut .
__label__negative	It might as well have been Problem Child IV .
__label__positive	It might be tempting to regard Mr. Andrew and his collaborators as oddballs , but Mr. Earnhart's quizzical , charming movie allows us to see them , finally , as artists .
__label__neutral	It might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a Three's Company-style laugh track .
__label__very_positive	It never fails to engage us .
__label__very_positive	It represents better-than-average movie-making that doesn't demand a dumb , distracted audience .
__label__negative	It risks seeming slow and pretentious , because it thinks the gamble is worth the promise .
__label__neutral	It seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less .
__label__negative	It settles for being merely grim .
__label__very_positive	It should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit .
__label__negative	It smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original .
__label__positive	It suggests the wide-ranging effects of media manipulation , from the kind of reporting that is done by the supposedly liberal media ... to the intimate and ultimately tragic heartache of maverick individuals like Hatfield and Hicks .
__label__positive	It takes this never-ending confusion and hatred , puts a human face on it , evokes shame among all who are party to it and even promotes understanding .
__label__neutral	It tells more than it shows .
__label__very_negative	It took 19 predecessors to get THIS ?
__label__negative	It tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world .
__label__very_positive	It turns out to be a cut above the norm , thanks to some clever writing and sprightly acting .
__label__neutral	It ultimately stands forth as an important chronicle of the abuses of one of Latin America's most oppressive regimes .
__label__positive	It uses an old-time formula , it's not terribly original and it's rather messy -- but you just have to love the big , dumb , happy movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding .
__label__negative	It virtually defines a comedy that's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while .
__label__neutral	It wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy .
__label__negative	It will come as no surprise that the movie isn't scary .
__label__very_positive	It will delight newcomers to the story and those who know it from bygone days .
__label__neutral	It will probably prove interesting to Ram Dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture .
__label__negative	It won't be long before you'll spy I Spy at a video store near you .
__label__neutral	It won't bust your gut -- and it's not intended to -- it's merely a blandly cinematic surgical examination of what makes a joke a joke .
__label__neutral	It won't rock any boats but is solid meat-and-potatoes filmmaking .
__label__very_negative	It would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun .
__label__neutral	It would be interesting to hear from the other side , but in Talk to Her , the women are down for the count .
__label__neutral	It would have benefitted the dialogue .
__label__very_negative	It wouldn't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $ 7.00 .
__label__negative	Its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper .
__label__positive	Its direction , its script , and Weaver's performance as a vaguely discontented woman of substance make for a mildly entertaining 77 minutes , if that's what you're in the mood for .
__label__negative	Its gross-out gags and colorful set pieces ... are of course stultifyingly contrived and too stylized by half .
__label__negative	Its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent Dumas botch-jobs , The Man in the Iron Mask and The Musketeer .
__label__negative	Its mysteries are transparently obvious , and it's too slowly paced to be a thriller .
__label__negative	Its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops .
__label__negative	Its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing .
__label__positive	Its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time .
__label__very_negative	Its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : Since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ?
__label__neutral	Ja Rule and Kurupt should have gotten to rap .
__label__positive	Jacquot's Tosca is a treat .
__label__positive	Jagger the actor is someone you want to see again .
__label__positive	Japan's premier stylist of sex and blood hits audiences with what may be his most demented film to date .
__label__positive	Jason X has cheesy effects and a hoary plot , but its macabre , self-deprecating sense of humor makes up for a lot .
__label__very_negative	John Leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie .
__label__very_negative	John McTiernan's botched remake may be subtler than Norman Jewison's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga .
__label__neutral	Johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to .
__label__negative	Jolie's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips .
__label__very_negative	Julia is played with exasperating blandness by Laura Regan .
__label__negative	Just a bloody mess .
__label__very_negative	Just another fish-out-of-water story that barely stays afloat .
__label__negative	Just because it really happened to you , honey , doesn't mean that it's interesting to anyone else .
__label__neutral	Just how extreme are these ops ?
__label__very_negative	Just like Hearst's enormous yacht , it's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination .
__label__neutral	Just like every other Seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail .
__label__very_negative	Just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story .
__label__neutral	Just one problem : Fish out of water usually die .
__label__neutral	Just what makes us happy , anyway ?
__label__negative	Just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos .
__label__negative	K-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy Saving Private Ryanovich .
__label__neutral	Karmen moves like rhythm itself , her lips chanting to the beat , her long , braided hair doing little to wipe away the jeweled beads of sweat .
__label__positive	Katz uses archival footage , horrifying documents of lynchings , still photographs and charming old reel-to-reel recordings of Meeropol entertaining his children to create his song history , but most powerful of all is the song itself
__label__positive	Kaufman creates an eerie sense of not only being there at the time of these events but the very night Matthew was killed .
__label__very_positive	Kinnear gives a tremendous performance .
__label__negative	Kwan makes the mix-and - match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action .
__label__very_negative	Lacking gravitas , MacDowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel .
__label__very_negative	Lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose .
__label__very_negative	Lame , haphazard teen comedy .
__label__negative	Lanie's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she's driven by ambition and Doesn't Know How to Have Fun .
__label__neutral	Largely a for-fans artifact .
__label__very_positive	Lathan and Diggs have considerable personal charm , and their screen rapport makes the old story seem new .
__label__very_positive	Lauren Ambrose comes alive under the attention from two strangers in town - with honest performances and realistic interaction between the characters , this is a coming-of-age story with a twist .
__label__neutral	Lawrence preaches strictly to the converted .
__label__very_positive	Lead provocatuers Testud and Parmentier give superlative performances
__label__very_positive	Leave it to Rohmer , now 82 , to find a way to bend current technique to the service of a vision of the past that is faithful to both architectural glories and commanding open spaces of the city as it was more than two centuries ago .
__label__very_negative	Leave these Flowers unpicked -- they're dead on the vine .
__label__negative	Leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness .
__label__positive	Led by Griffin's smartly nuanced performance and enthusiasm , the cast has a lot of fun with the material .
__label__positive	Lee Jeong-Hyang tells it so lovingly and films it so beautifully that I couldn't help being captivated by it .
__label__positive	Legendary Irish writer Brendan Behan's memoir , Borstal Boy , has been given a loving screen transferral .
__label__very_negative	Let's cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : Stay home .
__label__negative	Let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested .
__label__negative	Life is a crock -- or something like it .
__label__neutral	Light , cute and forgettable .
__label__very_positive	Like Dickens with his passages , McGrath crafts quite moving scenes throughout his resolutely dramatic variation on the novel .
__label__negative	Like Mike doesn't win any points for originality .
__label__neutral	Like a documentary version of Fight Club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest .
__label__negative	Like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it .
__label__negative	Like a south-of-the-border Melrose Place .
__label__very_negative	Like a tone-deaf singer at a benefit concert , John Q. is a bad movie appearing on behalf of a good cause .
__label__negative	Like its two predecessors , 1983's Koyaanisqatsi and 1988's Powaqqatsi , the cinematic collage Naqoyqatsi could be the most navel-gazing film ever .
__label__negative	Like most Bond outings in recent years , some of the stunts are so outlandish that they border on being cartoonlike .
__label__negative	Like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness .
__label__positive	Like old myths and wonder tales spun afresh .
__label__very_negative	Like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in The Twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten .
__label__positive	Like the film's almost anthropologically detailed realization of early - '80s suburbia , it's significant without being overstated .
__label__negative	Like those to Rome , all roads in The Banger Sisters inevitably lead to a joke about Hawn's breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them .
__label__neutral	Lilia's transformation from strict mother to sensual siren is superficially preposterous , but Abbas infuses the role with an unimpeachable core of emotional truth .
__label__negative	Liman , of Swingers and Go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase .
__label__neutral	Literally nothing in The Pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980's this one should appease you for 90 minutes .
__label__negative	Little more than a frothy vanity project .
__label__neutral	Long after you leave Justine , you'll be wondering what will happen to her and wishing her the best -- whatever that might mean .
__label__positive	Longley has constructed a remarkably coherent , horrifically vivid snapshot of those turbulent days .
__label__positive	Look , this is a terrific flick replete with dazzling camera-work , dancing and music .
__label__negative	Looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a Mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter's imagination .
__label__very_negative	Looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due .
__label__positive	Lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically .
__label__neutral	Lucas , take notes .
__label__very_negative	Made by jackasses for jackasses .
__label__very_negative	Madonna still can't act a lick .
__label__positive	Maguire is a surprisingly effective Peter\/Spider-Man .
__label__positive	Majidi's poetic love story is a ravishing consciousness-raiser , if a bit draggy at times .
__label__positive	Majidi gets uniformly engaging performances from his largely amateur cast .
__label__very_positive	Makes S&M seem very romantic , and Maggie Gyllenhaal is a delight .
__label__positive	Makes an aborbing if arguable case for the man's greatness .
__label__positive	Makmalbaf follows a resolutely realistic path in this uncompromising insight into the harsh existence of the Kurdish refugees of Iran's borderlands .
__label__neutral	Manages to be original , even though it rips off many of its ideas .
__label__very_negative	Marisa Tomei is good , but Just A Kiss is just a mess .
__label__negative	Mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor .
__label__negative	Marries the amateurishness of The Blair Witch Project with the illogic of Series 7 : The Contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie .
__label__positive	Marvelous , merry and , yes , melancholy film .
__label__very_negative	Matthew McConaughey tries , and fails , to control the screen with swaggering machismo and over-the-top lunacy .
__label__negative	Maudlin and melodramatic we expected .
__label__positive	May be spoofing an easy target -- those old ' 50's giant creature features -- but ... it acknowledges and celebrates their cheesiness as the reason why people get a kick out of watching them today .
__label__negative	Maybe I found the proceedings a little bit too conventional .
__label__negative	Maybe it's asking too much , but if a movie is truly going to inspire me , I want a little more than this .
__label__neutral	Maybe it's just because this past year has seen the release of some of the worst film comedies in decades ... But honestly , Analyze That really isn't all that bad .
__label__negative	Maybe it's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul `` Full Frontal '' seems , well , contrived .
__label__negative	McKay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
__label__very_negative	Meandering , sub-aquatic mess : It's so bad it's good , but only if you slide in on a freebie .
__label__neutral	Melanie eventually slugs the Yankee .
__label__negative	Men in Black II has sequel-itis something fierce .
__label__positive	Merchant effectively translates Naipaul's lively mix of characters from the page to screen .
__label__positive	Merely as a technical , logistical feat , Russian Ark marks a cinematic milestone .
__label__positive	Message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ?
__label__negative	Might have been better off as a documentary , with less of Mr. Eyre's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage .
__label__very_positive	Mixes likeable personalities , inventive photography and cutting , and wall-to-wall toe-tapping music to paint a picture of a subculture that is at once exhilarating , silly , perverse , hopeful and always fun .
__label__neutral	Mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty .
__label__negative	Mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness .
__label__negative	Moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance .
__label__very_positive	Moore's complex and important film is also , believe it or not , immensely entertaining , a David and Goliath story that's still very much playing itself out .
__label__positive	Moore's performance impresses almost as much as her work with Haynes in 1995's Safe .
__label__negative	Moot point .
__label__positive	More a load of enjoyable , Conan-esque claptrap than the punishing , special-effects soul assaults the Mummy pictures represent .
__label__positive	More honest about Alzheimer's disease , I think , than Iris .
__label__positive	More than makes up for its mawkish posing by offering rousing spates of genuine feeling .
__label__neutral	Morrissette's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit -- but it doesn't signify a whole lot either .
__label__very_positive	Morton is , as usual , brilliant .
__label__neutral	Morton is a great actress portraying a complex character , but Morvern Callar grows less compelling the farther it meanders from its shocking start .
__label__very_positive	Most impressive , though , is the film's open-ended finale that refuses to entirely close its characters ' emotional wounds .
__label__positive	Most new movies have a bright sheen .
__label__positive	Most of Crush is a clever and captivating romantic comedy with a welcome pinch of tartness .
__label__negative	Most of the action setups are incoherent .
__label__very_negative	Most of the supporting characters in Eastwood films are weak , as are most of the subplots .
__label__neutral	Movies like this are selling the old European candor , the old wink of ` bold ' revelation .
__label__very_positive	Mr. Parker has brilliantly updated his source and grasped its essence , composing a sorrowful and hilarious tone poem about alienated labor , or an absurdist workplace sitcom .
__label__positive	Mr. Wedge and Mr. Saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well .
__label__positive	Ms. Fulford-Wierzbicki is almost spooky in her sulky , calculating Lolita turn .
__label__very_positive	Much monkeyfun for all .
__label__very_positive	Much of the way , though , this is a refreshingly novel ride .
__label__negative	Much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie .
__label__very_negative	Murder By Numbers is like a couple of mediocre TV-movie - of-the-week films clumsily stuck together .
__label__negative	Murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous .
__label__very_positive	Murderous Maids may well be the most comprehensive of these films and also strike closest to the truth .
__label__positive	Must be seen to be believed .
__label__very_positive	Must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry .
__label__positive	My goodness , Queen Latifah has a lot to offer and she seemed to have no problem flaunting her natural gifts .
__label__very_positive	My oh my , is this an invigorating , electric movie .
__label__negative	My response to the film is best described as lukewarm .
__label__negative	Myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another .
__label__positive	Nair does capture the complexity of a big family and its trials and tribulations ...
__label__positive	Narc may not get an ` A ' for originality , but it wears its B-movie heritage like a badge of honor .
__label__very_negative	National Lampoon's Van Wilder could be the worst thing to come out of National Lampoon since Class Reunion
__label__negative	Nearly surreal , dabbling in French , this is no simple movie , and you'll be taking a risk if you choose to see it .
__label__very_negative	Needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey .
__label__very_negative	Neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well-drawn .
__label__positive	Nervy and sensitive , it taps into genuine artistic befuddlement , and at the same time presents a scathing indictment of what drives Hollywood .
__label__negative	Never Again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds .
__label__negative	Never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful .
__label__negative	Never mind whether you buy the stuff about Barris being a CIA hit man .
__label__negative	Never quite transcends jokester status ... and the punchline doesn't live up to Barry's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery .
__label__very_negative	New Best Friend shouldn't have gone straight to video ; it should have gone straight to a Mystery Science Theater 3000 video .
__label__very_positive	Newton draws our attention like a magnet , and acts circles around her better known co-star , Mark Wahlberg .
__label__positive	Nicely serves as an examination of a society in transition .
__label__very_positive	Nicolas Philibert observes life inside a one-room schoolhouse in northern France in his documentary To Be and to Have , easily one of the best films of the year .
__label__negative	No , it's not nearly as good as any of its influences .
__label__very_negative	No , it's the repetition of said behavior , and so Children of the Century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else .
__label__negative	No more .
__label__negative	No movement , no yuks , not much of anything .
__label__negative	No number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story .
__label__neutral	No question .
__label__very_negative	No reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned bucks into a movie which obviously didn't invest much into itself either .
__label__neutral	No wonder they're talking about `` Talk to Her . ''
__label__neutral	No worse than a lot of the crap we've been offered this summer , and slightly better than Men in Black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go .
__label__negative	No. .
__label__positive	Nolan bravely treads where few American films dare to delve -- into the world of ambivalence and ambiguity ...
__label__negative	None of these characters resembles anyone you've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter .
__label__negative	None of this violates the letter of Behan's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor .
__label__negative	Not ` terrible filmmaking ' bad , but more like , ' I once had a nightmare like this , and it's now coming true ' bad .
__label__positive	Not a bad journey at all .
__label__neutral	Not a cheap slasher flick , as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey .
__label__positive	Not a cozy or ingratiating work , but it's challenging , sometimes clever , and always interesting , and those are reasons enough to see it .
__label__negative	Not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it's almost funny .
__label__neutral	Not as distinctive or even as humorous as its needs to be to stand out , but it has clearly been made with affection and care .
__label__very_negative	Not even the Hanson Brothers can save it
__label__negative	Not every animated film from Disney will become a classic , but forgive me if I've come to expect more from this studio than some 79-minute after-school `` cartoon '' .
__label__positive	Not everything works , but the average is higher than in Mary and most other recent comedies .
__label__positive	Not for everyone , but for those with whom it will connect , it's a nice departure from standard moviegoing fare .
__label__negative	Not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality , it fails the most basic relevancy test as well .
__label__negative	Not so much a movie as a picture book for the big screen .
__label__negative	Not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined TV amiability that Allen personifies .
__label__negative	Not sweet enough to liven up its predictable story and will leave even fans of hip-hop sorely disappointed .
__label__positive	Not too far below the gloss you can still feel director Denis Villeneuve's beating heart and the fondness he has for his characters .
__label__negative	Nothing Denis has made before , like Beau Travil and Nenette et Boni , could prepare us for this gory , perverted , sex-soaked riff on the cannibal genre .
__label__negative	Nothing about it fits .
__label__very_negative	Nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and Showtime is crammed full of them .
__label__very_negative	Nothing more than a mediocre trifle .
__label__negative	Nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about .
__label__negative	Notorious C.H.O. has oodles of vulgar highlights .
__label__very_positive	Novak manages to capture a cruelly hilarious vein of black comedy in the situation with his cast of non-actors and a gritty , no-budget approach .
__label__negative	Now , if it only had a brain .
__label__very_negative	Now it's a bad , embarrassing movie .
__label__negative	Now it's just tired .
__label__positive	Now trimmed by about 20 minutes , this lavish three-year-old production has enough grandeur and scale to satisfy as grown-up escapism .
__label__positive	Noyce's film is contemplative and mournfully reflective .
__label__neutral	Noyce films it more as a shocking history lesson than as drama .
__label__very_negative	Obstacles are too easily overcome and there isn't much in the way of character development in the script .
__label__negative	Obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of Hey Arnold !
__label__positive	Occasionally , in the course of reviewing art-house obscurities and slam-bam action flicks , a jaded critic smacks into something truly new .
__label__neutral	Occasionally amateurishly made but a winsome cast and nice dialogue keeps it going .
__label__positive	Occasionally funny and consistently odd , and it works reasonably well as a star vehicle for Zhao .
__label__positive	Occasionally melodramatic , it's also extremely effective .
__label__very_negative	Oedekerk wrote Patch Adams , for which he should not be forgiven .
__label__negative	Offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented .
__label__very_positive	Offers a breath of the fresh air of true sophistication .
__label__neutral	Offers an unusual opportunity to observe the inequities in the death penalty , not just the inherent immorality but also the haphazard administration of it and public misperception of how the whole thing works .
__label__very_positive	Offers enough playful fun to entertain the preschool set while embracing a wholesome attitude .
__label__very_positive	Offers that rare combination of entertainment and education .
__label__negative	Oft-described as the antidote to American Pie-type sex comedies , it actually has a bundle in common with them , as the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough
__label__very_positive	Often gruelling and heartbreaking to witness , but Seldahl and Wollter's sterling performances raise this far above the level of the usual maudlin disease movie .
__label__very_positive	Often hilarious , well-shot and , importantly , entertaining , Hell House is a fascinating document of an event that has to be seen to be believed .
__label__neutral	Often moving and explores the discomfort inherent in the contacts between the American ` hosts ' and their ` guests . '
__label__neutral	Oh , it's extreme , all right .
__label__very_positive	On its own cinematic terms , it successfully showcases the passions of both the director and novelist Byatt .
__label__negative	On the right track to something that's creepy and effective ... It's just going to take more than a man in a Bullwinkle costume to get there .
__label__positive	On the surface , it's a lovers-on-the-run crime flick , but it has a lot in common with Piesiewicz's and Kieslowski's earlier work , films like The Double Life of Veronique .
__label__positive	Once again , director Jackson strikes a rewarding balance between emotion on the human scale and action\/effects on the spectacular scale .
__label__negative	Once the audience figure out what's being said , the filmmaker's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care .
__label__positive	Once you get into its rhythm ... the movie becomes a heady experience .
__label__negative	One Hour Photo is an intriguing snapshot of one man and his delusions ; it's just too bad it doesn't have more flashes of insight .
__label__negative	One groan-inducing familiarity begets another .
__label__negative	One minute , you think you're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it's as though clips from The Pink Panther Strikes Again and\/or Sailor Moon have been spliced in .
__label__very_positive	One of the best examples of how to treat a subject , you're not fully aware is being examined , much like a photo of yourself you didn't know was being taken .
__label__very_positive	One of the best of the year .
__label__very_positive	One of the greatest family-oriented , fantasy-adventure movies ever .
__label__very_positive	One of the greatest romantic comedies of the past decade .
__label__positive	One of the most haunting , viciously honest coming-of-age films in recent memory .
__label__negative	One of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating .
__label__very_positive	One of those rare , exhilarating cinematic delights that gets even better in hindsight , as you mull over its every nuance in your mind .
__label__positive	One scarcely needs the subtitles to enjoy this colorful action farce .
__label__neutral	Only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry .
__label__very_positive	Only an epic documentary could get it all down , and Spike Lee's Jim Brown : All American at long last gives its subject a movie worthy of his talents .
__label__neutral	Only two words will tell you what you know when deciding to see it : Anthony .
__label__negative	Opens as promising as any war\/adventure film you'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled `` Glory : A Soldier's Story . ''
__label__very_negative	Opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist's death bed and doesn't get much livelier in the three hours in between .
__label__neutral	Or , you can do something fun tonight .
__label__neutral	Or Tom Green as Han Solo ?
__label__neutral	Or a profit .
__label__negative	Or some damn thing .
__label__negative	Ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive .
__label__very_negative	Others may find it migraine-inducing , despite Moore's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding .
__label__negative	Outrageousness is all Plympton seemed to be going for this time .
__label__neutral	Over-the-top and a bit ostentatious , this is a movie that's got oodles of style and substance .
__label__negative	Overall , the film misses the brilliance of Jelinek's novel by some way .
__label__positive	Painful to watch , but viewers willing to take a chance will be rewarded with two of the year's most accomplished and riveting film performances .
__label__very_positive	Parker holds true to Wilde's own vision of a pure comedy with absolutely no meaning , and no desire to be anything but a polished , sophisticated entertainment that is in love with its own cleverness .
__label__neutral	Parker probably thinks he's shaking up a classic the way Kenneth Branagh and Baz Luhrmann have , but this half-hearted messing-about just makes us miss Wilde's still-contemporary play .
__label__neutral	Part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas , but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole .
__label__neutral	Passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless .
__label__neutral	Passion , lip-synching , tragedy , and lots of really really high notes .
__label__positive	Perhaps no picture ever made has more literally showed that the road to hell is paved with good intentions .
__label__very_negative	Philip K. Dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach .
__label__negative	Places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller .
__label__negative	Plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights .
__label__negative	Plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial .
__label__neutral	Polished Korean political-action film is just as good -- and bad -- as Hollywood action epics .
__label__neutral	Possession is Elizabeth Barrett Browning meets Nancy Drew , and it's directed by ... Neil LaBute .
__label__positive	Pray's film works well and will appeal even to those who aren't too familiar with turntablism .
__label__negative	Preposterous and tedious , Sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure .
__label__positive	Presents an astute appraisal of Middle American musical torpor and the desperate struggle to escape it .
__label__negative	Pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick .
__label__positive	Pretty darn good , despite its smarty-pants aura .
__label__negative	Proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism ... and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday's weather report .
__label__negative	Propelled not by characters but by caricatures .
__label__very_negative	Proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie .
__label__very_positive	Provides an intriguing window into the imagination and hermetic analysis of Todd Solondz .
__label__negative	Pryor Lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs .
__label__negative	Pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless Todd Solondzian satire and callow student film .
__label__negative	Punish the vehicle to adore the star .
__label__neutral	Purely propaganda , a work of unabashed hero worship , it is nonetheless -- and likely inadvertently -- a timely and invaluable implicit reminder of the role that U.S. foreign policy has played in the rise of Castro .
__label__negative	Quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ?
__label__positive	Quite funny for the type of movie it is ...
__label__very_positive	Rain is a small treasure , enveloping the viewer in a literal and spiritual torpor that is anything but cathartic .
__label__negative	Rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down .
__label__very_negative	Rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next .
__label__very_positive	Ranging from funny to shattering and featuring some of the year's best acting , Personal Velocity gathers plenty of dramatic momentum .
__label__very_positive	Ranks among Willams ' best screen work .
__label__very_positive	Rare is the ` urban comedy ' that even attempts the insight and honesty of this disarming indie .
__label__very_positive	Rarely do films come along that are as intelligent , exuberant , and moving as Monsoon Wedding .
__label__negative	Rates an ` E ' for effort -- and a ` B ' for boring .
__label__very_negative	Rather , you'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief .
__label__positive	Rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation .
__label__negative	Ray Liotta and Jason Patric do some of their best work in their underwritten roles , but don't be fooled : Nobody deserves any prizes here .
__label__neutral	Recalls quiet freak-outs like L'Avventura and Repulsion .
__label__negative	Reggio's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified Nike ad .
__label__negative	Reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film .
__label__positive	Reign of Fire may be little more than another platter of reheated Aliens , but it's still pretty tasty .
__label__positive	Reinforces the often forgotten fact of the world's remarkably varying human population and mindset , and its capacity to heal using creative , natural and ancient antidotes .
__label__positive	Reinforces the talents of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman , creator of Adaptation and Being John Malkovich .
__label__neutral	Remains a solid , if somewhat heavy-handed , account of the near-disaster ... done up by Howard with a steady , if not very imaginative , hand .
__label__very_positive	Remarkably accessible and affecting .
__label__negative	Remember when Bond had more glamour than clamor ?
__label__very_positive	Renner's performance as Dahmer is unforgettable , deeply absorbing .
__label__very_positive	Resourceful and ingenious entertainment .
__label__very_positive	Rich in detail , gorgeously shot and beautifully acted , Les Destinees is , in its quiet , epic way , daring , inventive and refreshingly unusual .
__label__very_negative	Ridiculous .
__label__negative	Ritchie's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people's faces to the fact Amber is such a joke .
__label__positive	Roger Michell , who did an appealing job directing Persuasion and Notting Hill in England , gets too artsy in his American debut .
__label__positive	Roman Coppola may never become the filmmaker his Dad was , but heck -- few filmmakers will .
__label__very_positive	Romanek keeps the film constantly taut ... reflecting the character's instability with a metaphorical visual style and an unnerving , heartbeat-like score .
__label__very_positive	Run , don't walk , to see this barbed and bracing comedy on the big screen .
__label__negative	Sadly , Hewitt's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks .
__label__negative	Safe Conduct , however ambitious and well-intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull's - eye .
__label__positive	Sam Jones became a very lucky filmmaker the day Wilco got dropped from their record label , proving that one man's ruin may be another's fortune .
__label__positive	Sandra Nettelbeck beautifully orchestrates the transformation of the chilly , neurotic , and self-absorbed Martha as her heart begins to open .
__label__negative	Say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue .
__label__negative	Scarlet Diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it's a lot less sensational than it wants to be .
__label__negative	Scene-by-scene , things happen , but you'd be hard-pressed to say what or why .
__label__negative	Schindler's List it ain't .
__label__very_negative	Schmaltzy and unfunny , Adam Sandler's cartoon about Hanukkah is numbingly bad , Little Nicky bad , 10 Worst List bad .
__label__positive	Scores a few points for doing what it does with a dedicated and good-hearted professionalism .
__label__neutral	Scotland , PA. blurs the line between black comedy and black hole .
__label__very_negative	Scotland , Pa. is a strangely drab romp .
__label__negative	Screenwriters Scott Abbott and Michael Petroni have turned Rice's complex Akasha into a cartoon monster .
__label__neutral	Search it out .
__label__neutral	Secret Ballot is too contemplative to be really funny .
__label__very_positive	Sensitive , insightful and beautifully rendered film .
__label__neutral	Sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary .
__label__very_positive	Serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in America in 2002 .
__label__negative	Sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution .
__label__neutral	Several degrees shy of the gross-out contests one expects from current teen fare .
__label__very_negative	Shadyac shoots his film like an M. Night Shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension .
__label__positive	Shainberg weaves a carefully balanced scenario that is controlled by neither character , is weirdly sympathetic to both and manages to be tender and darkly comic .
__label__very_negative	Shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme .
__label__very_positive	Sharp , lively , funny and ultimately sobering film .
__label__negative	She lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs .
__label__positive	She must have a very strong back .
__label__neutral	Sheridan ... smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth .
__label__negative	Shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker's bottomless pit of self-absorption .
__label__negative	Shot perhaps ` artistically ' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by Joaquin Baca-Asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity .
__label__negative	Showtime is closer to Slowtime .
__label__very_negative	Showtime is one of the hapless victims of the arrogant `` if we put together a wry white man and a chatty black man and give them guns , the movie will be funny '' syndrome .
__label__positive	Sits uneasily as a horror picture ... but finds surprising depth in its look at the binds of a small family .
__label__positive	Skip work to see it at the first opportunity .
__label__negative	Sluggishly directed by episodic TV veteran Joe Zwick , it's a sitcom without the snap-crackle .
__label__positive	Smart science fiction for grown-ups , with only a few false steps along the way .
__label__positive	Smith's approach is never to tease , except gently and in that way that makes us consider our own eccentricities and how they are expressed through our homes .
__label__very_positive	Smith's point is simple and obvious -- people's homes are extensions of themselves , and particularly eccentric people have particularly eccentric living spaces -- but his subjects are charmers .
__label__positive	Smith profiles five extraordinary American homes , and because the owners seem fully aware of the uses and abuses of fame , it's a pleasure to enjoy their eccentricities .
__label__neutral	So I just did .
__label__neutral	So faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check .
__label__negative	So few movies explore religion that it's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler .
__label__negative	So lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun .
__label__positive	So many documentaries like this presuppose religious bigotry or zealous nuttiness of its antagonists , but Family Fundamentals displays a rare gift for unflinching impartiality .
__label__neutral	So relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something .
__label__negative	So routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated Final Draft computer program .
__label__very_negative	So stupid , so ill-conceived , so badly drawn , it created whole new levels of ugly .
__label__very_negative	So what is the point ?
__label__very_positive	So young , so smart , such talent , such a wise \*\*\* .
__label__positive	Solid , lump-in-the-throat family entertainment that derives its power by sticking to the facts .
__label__very_negative	Some , like Ballistic , arrive stillborn ... looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future .
__label__positive	Some actors have so much charisma that you'd be happy to listen to them reading the phone book .
__label__neutral	Some actors steal scenes .
__label__negative	Some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations .
__label__positive	Some movies are like a tasty hors-d'oeuvre ; this one is a feast .
__label__very_negative	Some of Seagal's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot .
__label__negative	Some studio pizazz might have helped .
__label__neutral	Somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional .
__label__negative	Somehow we're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become G.I. Jane .
__label__neutral	Sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well .
__label__positive	Sometimes , nothing satisfies like old-fashioned swashbuckling .
__label__neutral	Sometimes , that's enough .
__label__neutral	Sometimes smart but more often sophomoric .
__label__very_positive	Somewhat blurred , but Kinnear's performance is razor sharp .
__label__negative	Somewhere short of Tremors on the modern B-scene : neither as funny nor as clever , though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes .
__label__negative	Son of the Bride may be a good half-hour too long but comes replete with a flattering sense of mystery and quietness .
__label__negative	Sorry , Charlie
__label__very_negative	Soul is what's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself .
__label__positive	Sound the trumpets : For the first time since Desperately Seeking Susan , Madonna doesn't suck as an actress .
__label__neutral	Spielberg is the rare director who does not want to invite viewers to gawk at or applaud his special effects .
__label__very_negative	Splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers ' puppet strings .
__label__very_negative	Spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama .
__label__positive	Star Wars is back in a major way .
__label__negative	Stars Matthew Perry and Elizabeth Hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately Serving Sara doesn't distinguish itself from the herd .
__label__negative	Starts off with a bang , but then fizzles like a wet stick of dynamite at the very end .
__label__negative	Static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , Hey Arnold !
__label__very_positive	Stay clear of reminding yourself that it's a `` true story '' and you're likely to have one helluva time at the movies .
__label__positive	Steers turns in a snappy screenplay that curls at the edges ; it's so clever you want to hate it .
__label__positive	Stephen Earnhart's homespun documentary Mule Skinner Blues has nothing but love for its posse of trailer park denizens .
__label__positive	Steve Irwin's method is Ernest Hemmingway at accelerated speed and volume .
__label__neutral	Stevenson's performance is at once clueless and fiercely committed , a volatile combination .
__label__negative	Still , I'm not quite sure what the point is ...
__label__negative	Still , I thought it could have been more .
__label__negative	Still , it gets the job done -- a sleepy afternoon rental .
__label__negative	Still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral .
__label__positive	Still pretentious and filled with subtext , but entertaining enough at ` face value ' to recommend to anyone looking for something different .
__label__negative	Strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and B-film thuggery .
__label__positive	Sturdy , entertaining period drama ... both Caine and Fraser have their moments .
__label__positive	Subversive , meditative , clinical and poetic , The Piano Teacher is a daring work of genius .
__label__positive	Succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the Police Academy series .
__label__negative	Succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the Touched by an Angel school of non-God spiritual-uplift movies .
__label__negative	Sucking all the ` classic ' out of Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and Disney-fied adolescent angst ...
__label__very_negative	Suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video .
__label__very_negative	Suffocated at conception by its Munchausen-by-proxy mum .
__label__negative	Suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let's just say the ingredients don't quite add up to a meal .
__label__negative	Sunshine State lacks the kind of dynamic that Limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece .
__label__positive	Superior genre storytelling , which gets under our skin simply by crossing the nuclear line .
__label__neutral	Sure , it's more of the same , but as the film proves , that's not always a bad thing .
__label__negative	Sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre .
__label__very_positive	Tadpole is a sophisticated , funny and good-natured treat , slight but a pleasure .
__label__neutral	Tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films : Young is cool , and too young is too cool .
__label__positive	Tailored to entertain !
__label__positive	Take Care of My Cat offers a refreshingly different slice of Asian cinema .
__label__neutral	Take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we've seen and all you have left are John Leguizamo's cool jackets .
__label__negative	Taken individually or collectively , the stories never add up to as much as they promise .
__label__neutral	Taken purely as an exercise in style , this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore .
__label__negative	Technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial .
__label__very_positive	Tender yet lacerating and darkly funny fable .
__label__neutral	Thankfully , the film , which skirts that rapidly deteriorating line between fantasy and reality ... takes a tongue-in-cheek attitude even as it pushes the Croc Hunter agenda .
__label__neutral	That's the only sane rationale I can think of for Swimfan's existence .
__label__positive	That Zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center , no less -- indicates where his ambitions have wandered .
__label__neutral	That is essentially what's missing from Blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point .
__label__very_positive	That rara avis : the intelligent romantic comedy with actual ideas on its mind .
__label__very_positive	The 3D images only enhance the film's otherworldly quality , giving it a strange combo of you-are-there closeness with the disorienting unreality of the seemingly broken-down fourth wall of the movie screen .
__label__neutral	The AM-radio soundtrack and game cast -- Tierney and the inimitable Walken especially -- keep this unusual comedy from choking on its own conceit .
__label__positive	The Bourne Identity is what summer screen escapism used to be in the decades when it was geared more to grownups .
__label__neutral	The Gantzes ' interviews tend to let the guys off the hook .
__label__very_positive	The Hours is what movies are supposed to be ...
__label__positive	The Hours makes you examine your own life in much the same way its characters do , and the experience is profound .
__label__very_negative	The Irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted .
__label__neutral	The Marquis de Sade couldn't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be .
__label__very_negative	The Master Of Disaster - it's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy .
__label__very_positive	The Movie will reach far beyond its core demographic .
__label__positive	The New Guy does have a heart .
__label__neutral	The New Guy is one of them .
__label__positive	The Pianist is a fine valedictory work for Polanski , made richer by his own experiences , making his other movies somehow richer in the bargain .
__label__very_negative	The Piano Teacher is the sort of movie that discourages American audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film .
__label__very_positive	The Powers team has fashioned a comedy with more laughs than many , no question .
__label__very_negative	The Ring just left me cold and wet like I was out in the Seattle drizzle without rainwear .
__label__very_negative	The Sum of All Fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there's something cringe-inducing about seeing an American football stadium nuked as pop entertainment .
__label__positive	The Transporter is as lively and as fun as it is unapologetically dumb
__label__very_positive	The WWII drama is well plotted , visually striking and filled with enjoyably complex characters who are never what they first appear .
__label__very_negative	The Weight of Water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat .
__label__very_positive	The acting alone is worth the price of admission .
__label__negative	The acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with Csokas particularly unconnected .
__label__very_negative	The acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from Gilligan's Island -- and the CGI Scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year .
__label__negative	The actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus .
__label__neutral	The actors are so terrific at conveying their young angst , we do indeed feel for them .
__label__very_negative	The actors don't inhabit their roles -- they're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes .
__label__neutral	The additional storyline is interesting and entertaining , but it doesn't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story .
__label__very_negative	The angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging .
__label__positive	The animated subplot keenly depicts the inner struggles of our adolescent heroes - insecure , uncontrolled , and intense .
__label__neutral	The appearance of Treebeard and Gollum's expanded role will either have you loving what you're seeing , or rolling your eyes .
__label__neutral	The attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven .
__label__neutral	The average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small-town America .
__label__very_negative	The backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense .
__label__very_positive	The best movie of its kind since ` Brazil . '
__label__positive	The best thing the film does is to show us not only what that mind looks like , but how the creative process itself operates .
__label__negative	The best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations .
__label__negative	The best you can say about it is it's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now .
__label__neutral	The cartoon is about as true to the spirit of the Festival of Lights as Mr. Deeds was to that of Frank Capra .
__label__very_negative	The cartoon that isn't really good enough to be on afternoon TV is now a movie that isn't really good enough to be in theaters .
__label__negative	The cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big ... and the setting remains indistinct .
__label__neutral	The cast is uniformly excellent ... but the film itself is merely mildly charming .
__label__very_positive	The cast is uniformly excellent and relaxed .
__label__negative	The central story lacks punch .
__label__negative	The character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and Clayburgh doesn't always improve the over-the-top mix .
__label__negative	The charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin .
__label__very_negative	The cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama .
__label__very_positive	The comic performances are all spot on , especially Lee Ross's turn as Ken .
__label__negative	The creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts ' haunting is routine .
__label__neutral	The crime matters less than the characters , although the filmmakers supply enough complications , close calls and double-crosses to satisfy us .
__label__neutral	The cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie's power as a work of drama .
__label__very_positive	The director , Steven Shainberg , has succeeded by focusing intently on his characters , making them quirky individuals rather than figures of fun .
__label__neutral	The disarming cornball atmosphere has a way of infecting the entire crowd as the film rolls on .
__label__positive	The diversity of the artists represented , both in terms of style and ethnicity , prevents the proceedings from feeling repetitious , as does the appropriately brief 40-minute running time .
__label__very_positive	The drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes .
__label__very_negative	The editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden .
__label__neutral	The element of surprise might be the only thing Femme Fatale has going for it .
__label__neutral	The ending does leave you unfulfilled , but these are performances to enjoy in a memorable ensemble piece .
__label__very_negative	The ending is a cop-out .
__label__negative	The enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized .
__label__positive	The episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life .
__label__negative	The essential problem in Orange County is that , having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast , the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do .
__label__positive	The experience of watching blobby old-school CGI animation in this superlarge format is just surreal enough to be diverting .
__label__very_positive	The fact that The Rookie is a nearly impeccable cinematic experience -- and a wonderful all-ages triumph besides -- is a miracle akin to the story the film portrays .
__label__negative	The fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious .
__label__negative	The film's 45-minute running time stops shy of overkill , though viewers may be more exhausted than the athletes onscreen .
__label__neutral	The film's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place .
__label__negative	The film's center will not hold .
__label__very_positive	The film's greatest asset is how much it's not just another connect-the-dots , spy-on-the-run picture .
__label__neutral	The film's implicit premise is that the faith of the Tonga people is in every way inferior to that of John .
__label__positive	The film's real appeal won't be to Clooney fans or adventure buffs , but to moviegoers who enjoy thinking about compelling questions with no easy answers .
__label__positive	The film's sharp , often mischievous sense of humor will catch some off guard ...
__label__neutral	The film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other .
__label__very_positive	The film benefits greatly from a less manic tone than its predecessor , as Cho appears to have settled comfortably into her skin .
__label__very_positive	The film delivers not just the full assault of Reno's immense wit and insight , but a time travel back to what it felt like during those unforgettably uncertain days .
__label__negative	The film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes .
__label__neutral	The film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending .
__label__very_positive	The film has just enough of everything -- re-enactments , archival footage , talking-head interviews -- and the music is simply sublime .
__label__positive	The film hinges on its performances , and both leads are up to the task .
__label__very_negative	The film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously .
__label__very_positive	The film is all a little Lit Crit 101 , but it's extremely well played and often very funny .
__label__positive	The film is an enjoyable family film -- pretty much aimed at any youngster who loves horses .
__label__neutral	The film is directed by Wally Wolodarsky from a script by Joe Jarvis and Greg Coolidge .
__label__very_positive	The film is exhilarating to watch because Sandler , liberated from the constraints of formula , reveals unexpected depths as an actor .
__label__positive	The film is faithful to what one presumes are the book's twin premises -- that we become who we are on the backs of our parents , but we have no idea who they were at our age ; and that time is a fleeting and precious commodity no matter how old you are .
__label__negative	The film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low .
__label__positive	The film is just a big , gorgeous , mind-blowing , breath-taking mess .
__label__very_negative	The film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off .
__label__very_positive	The film is often filled with a sense of pure wonderment and excitement not often seen in today's cinema du sarcasm
__label__positive	The film is painfully authentic , and the performances of the young players are utterly convincing .
__label__negative	The film is really not so much bad as bland .
__label__positive	The film is surprisingly well-directed by Brett Ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act .
__label__positive	The film makes a strong case for the importance of the musicians in creating the Motown sound .
__label__very_negative	The film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in Chinese history : war , revolution , Communism , etc. .
__label__negative	The film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but wasn't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing .
__label__negative	The film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles .
__label__very_positive	The film often achieves a mesmerizing poetry .
__label__very_positive	The film overcomes the regular minefield of coming-of-age cliches with potent doses of honesty and sensitivity .
__label__neutral	The film provides some great insight into the neurotic mindset of all comics -- even those who have reached the absolute top of the game .
__label__positive	The film runs on equal parts of innocence and wisdom -- wisdom that comes with experience .
__label__very_negative	The film seems a dead weight .
__label__neutral	The film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future Quentin Tarantino picture
__label__positive	The film starts out as competent but unremarkable ... and gradually grows into something of considerable power .
__label__negative	The film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next .
__label__very_negative	The film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave .
__label__negative	The filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women .
__label__positive	The filmmakers skillfully evoke the sense of menace that nature holds for many urban dwellers .
__label__neutral	The final result makes for adequate entertainment , I suppose , but anyone who has seen Chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal .
__label__neutral	The heightened symmetry of this new\/old Cinema Paradiso makes the film a fuller experience , like an old friend haunted by the exigencies of time .
__label__negative	The humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny .
__label__negative	The ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch .
__label__negative	The impact of the Armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day .
__label__very_positive	The inherent strength of the material as well as the integrity of the filmmakers gives this coming-of-age story restraint as well as warmth .
__label__positive	The invincible Werner Herzog is alive and well and living in LA
__label__negative	The issue of faith is not explored very deeply
__label__neutral	The journey toward redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full-blown movie .
__label__negative	The kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion .
__label__neutral	The kind of nervous film that will either give you a mild headache or exhilarate you .
__label__very_positive	The kooky yet shadowy vision Clooney sustains throughout is daring , inventive and impressive .
__label__negative	The lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary .
__label__negative	The lack of pace kills it , although , in a movie about cancer , this might be apt .
__label__positive	The laser-projected paintings provide a spell-casting beauty , while Russell and Dreyfus are a romantic pairing of hearts , preciously exposed as history corners them .
__label__positive	The latest installment in the Pokemon canon , Pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the Japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where Pokemon graze in peace .
__label__very_positive	The level of maturity displayed by this 33-year-old first-time feature director is astonishing , considering her inexperience and her subject matter .
__label__positive	The long-range appeal of `` Minority Report '' should transcend any awards it bags .
__label__negative	The low-budget Full Frontal was one of the year's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and Solaris is its big-budget brother .
__label__very_negative	The makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep .
__label__negative	The more Kevin Costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like Dragonfly tossed at them .
__label__negative	The movie's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension .
__label__positive	The movie's eventual success should be credited to Dennis Quaid , in fighting trim shape as an athlete as well as an actor
__label__very_positive	The movie's quiet affirmation of neighborhood values gives it an honest , lived-in glow .
__label__positive	The movie's ripe , enrapturing beauty will tempt those willing to probe its inscrutable mysteries .
__label__neutral	The movie addresses a hungry need for PG-rated , nonthreatening family movies , but it doesn't go too much further .
__label__negative	The movie bounces all over the map .
__label__positive	The movie exists for its soccer action and its fine acting .
__label__negative	The movie feels like it's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens .
__label__negative	The movie gets muted and routine .
__label__very_positive	The movie has a soft , percolating magic , a deadpan suspense .
__label__very_positive	The movie has an avalanche of eye-popping visual effects .
__label__very_positive	The movie has lots of dancing and fabulous music .
__label__negative	The movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs .
__label__very_positive	The movie is a blast of educational energy , as bouncy animation and catchy songs escort you through the entire 85 minutes .
__label__very_negative	The movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel .
__label__very_positive	The movie is full of fine performances , led by Josef Bierbichler as Brecht and Monica Bleibtreu as Helene Weigel , his wife .
__label__neutral	The movie isn't always easy to look at .
__label__very_positive	The movie is one of the best examples of artful Large Format filmmaking you are likely to see anytime soon .
__label__neutral	The movie is saved from unbearable lightness by the simplicity of the storytelling and the authenticity of the performances .
__label__neutral	The movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students .
__label__positive	The movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll .
__label__very_negative	The movie makes absolutely no sense .
__label__negative	The movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable .
__label__positive	The movie stays afloat thanks to its hallucinatory production design .
__label__neutral	The movie sticks much closer to Hornby's drop-dead confessional tone than the film version of High Fidelity did .
__label__negative	The movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark .
__label__negative	The movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun .
__label__neutral	The new faces are interesting , but the old story isn't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted .
__label__negative	The noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in Sorority Boys , whose makers apparently believe that women's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction .
__label__very_negative	The only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll .
__label__negative	The only thing in Pauline and Paulette that you haven't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized Oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers .
__label__negative	The only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team .
__label__very_negative	The only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill Hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound .
__label__very_negative	The only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare .
__label__very_negative	The overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than , say , ten ... make that three minutes .
__label__negative	The overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there's still a real sense that the Star Trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction .
__label__neutral	The pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie's final scenes .
__label__very_positive	The passions aroused by the discord between old and new cultures are set against the strange , stark beauty of the Mideast desert , so lovingly and perceptively filmed that you can almost taste the desiccated air .
__label__very_positive	The people in Dogtown and Z-Boys are so funny , aggressive and alive , you have to watch them because you can't wait to see what they do next .
__label__positive	The perfect film for those who like sick comedies that can be snide .
__label__negative	The performances are so leaden , Michael Rymer's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud .
__label__negative	The period -- swinging London in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in Gangster No. 1 , but falls apart long before the end .
__label__negative	The picture , scored by a perversely cheerful Marcus Miller accordion\/harmonica\/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety .
__label__negative	The picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn .
__label__negative	The pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film can't help but go soft and stinky .
__label__positive	The pleasures of Super Troopers may be fleeting , but they'll register strongly with anybody who still retains a soft spot for precollegiate humor .
__label__very_negative	The plot grinds on with yawn-provoking dullness .
__label__negative	The plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before Sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset .
__label__negative	The plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television - caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy .
__label__negative	The plot is very clever , but Boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of .
__label__negative	The premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written ... in the thrall of a vicious hangover .
__label__very_negative	The premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them .
__label__negative	The premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the Clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences .
__label__very_positive	The principals in this cast are all fine , but Bishop and Stevenson are standouts .
__label__negative	The problem , it is with most of these things , is the script .
__label__negative	The problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of Schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .
__label__neutral	The problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , Mr. Desplechin is content to state it .
__label__negative	The problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there's no saving the movie .
__label__negative	The problem with this film is that it's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot .
__label__positive	The production values are up there .
__label__neutral	The reason I found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory .
__label__positive	The reason this picture works better than its predecessors is that Myers is no longer simply spoofing the mini-mod-madness of '60s spy movies .
__label__negative	The reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone .
__label__neutral	The recording session is the only part of the film that is enlightening -- and how appreciative you are of this depends on your level of fandom .
__label__neutral	The rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it's more comedy than suspense De Palma creates .
__label__positive	The result is mesmerizing -- filled with menace and squalor .
__label__negative	The result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached .
__label__very_positive	The result is something quite fresh and delightful .
__label__negative	The sad thing about Knockaround Guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is .
__label__negative	The saturation bombing of Reggio's images and Glass ' evocative music ... ultimately leaves viewers with the task of divining meaning .
__label__positive	The scope of the Silberstein family is large and we grow attached to their lives , full of strength , warmth and vitality . .
__label__negative	The screenplay sabotages the movie's strengths at almost every juncture .
__label__neutral	The seaside splendor and shallow , beautiful people are nice to look at while you wait for the story to get going .
__label__very_positive	The second chapter of the Harry Potter series is even more magical than the first and simply the best family film of the year .
__label__very_negative	The sequel has turned completely and irrevocably bizarre to the point of utter nonsense .
__label__negative	The situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels .
__label__very_positive	The smartest bonehead comedy of the summer .
__label__very_negative	The smug , oily demeanor that Donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named Pipe Dream is just repulsive .
__label__very_negative	The sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap .
__label__positive	The spark of special anime magic here is unmistakable and hard to resist .
__label__negative	The stories here suffer from the chosen format .
__label__very_negative	The story's so preposterous that I didn't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved .
__label__neutral	The story , like life , refuses to be simple , and the result is a compelling slice of awkward emotions .
__label__very_negative	The story ... is moldy and obvious .
__label__negative	The story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough .
__label__negative	The story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence .
__label__positive	The story feels more like a serious read , filled with heavy doses of always enticing Sayles dialogue .
__label__negative	The story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly - stunning insight that crime doesn't pay .
__label__neutral	The story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ?
__label__negative	The story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter Paul Pender overloads it with sugary bits of business .
__label__very_negative	The story loses its bite in a last-minute happy ending that's even less plausible than the rest of the picture .
__label__very_positive	The story may not be new , but Australian director John Polson , making his American feature debut , jazzes it up adroitly .
__label__neutral	The story wraps back around on itself in the kind of elegant symmetry that's rare in film today , but be warned : It's a slow slog to get there .
__label__negative	The streets , shot by cinematographer Michael Ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them .
__label__very_positive	The stunning , dreamlike visuals will impress even those viewers who have little patience for Euro-film pretension .
__label__very_negative	The stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002's first quarter .
__label__negative	The subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one .
__label__positive	The talents of the actors helps `` Moonlight Mile '' rise above its heart-on-its-sleeve writing .
__label__very_positive	The tenderness of the piece is still intact .
__label__negative	The thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker doesn't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case .
__label__negative	The timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off .
__label__very_negative	The title's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is .
__label__negative	The title Trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller .
__label__neutral	The title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you'll read anywhere .
__label__positive	The tone is balanced , reflective and reasonable .
__label__negative	The tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy .
__label__negative	The truth is that The Truth About Charlie gets increasingly tiresome .
__label__positive	The tug of war that ensues is as much a snapshot of modern China in microcosm as it is a crash course in movie mythology .
__label__negative	The tug-of-war at the core of Beijing Bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes .
__label__negative	The two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect .
__label__negative	The two leads chomp considerably more scenery with their acting than fire-breathing monsters barbecue with their breath ...
__label__very_negative	The unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession .
__label__very_positive	The unique tug-of-war with viewer expectations is undeniable , if not a pleasure in its own right .
__label__very_positive	The use of CGI and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick .
__label__positive	The values that have held the Enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage , self-sacrifice and patience under pressure .
__label__negative	The vampire thriller Blade II starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun -- toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout .
__label__positive	The visuals alone make Metropolis worth seeing .
__label__positive	The voices are fine as well .
__label__neutral	The warm presence of Zhao Benshan makes the preposterous lying hero into something more than he reasonably should be .
__label__very_positive	The way Coppola professes his love for movies -- both colorful pop junk and the classics that unequivocally qualify as art -- is giddily entertaining .
__label__neutral	The weakest of the four Harry Potter books has been transformed into the stronger of the two films by the thinnest of margins .
__label__positive	The whole cast looks to be having so much fun with the slapstick antics and silly street patois , tossing around obscure expressions like Bellini and Mullinski , that the compact 86 minutes breezes by .
__label__negative	The whole damn thing is ripe for the Jerry Springer crowd .
__label__negative	The whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit .
__label__neutral	The worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors
__label__negative	The writers , director Wally Wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : Kappa Rho Alpha Phi .
__label__very_positive	The year's happiest surprise , a movie that deals with a real subject in an always surprising way .
__label__negative	Their film falters , however , in its adherence to the Disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that I'd hoped the movie would avoid .
__label__very_positive	Theirs is a simple and heart-warming story , full of mirth that should charm all but the most cynical .
__label__negative	Then lower them a bit more .
__label__negative	Theology aside , why put someone who ultimately doesn't learn at the center of a kids ' story ?
__label__positive	There's a disreputable air about the whole thing , and that's what makes it irresistible .
__label__neutral	There's a disturbing ` Great White Hope ' undertone to The Other Side of Heaven that subtly undermines its message of Christian love and compassion .
__label__very_positive	There's a vastness implied in Metropolis that is just breathtaking .
__label__negative	There's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent .
__label__positive	There's enough science to make it count as educational , and enough beauty to make it unforgettable .
__label__negative	There's more scatological action in 8 Crazy Nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career .
__label__negative	There's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity .
__label__very_positive	There's no denying the physically spectacular qualities of the film ... or the emotional integrity of the performances .
__label__neutral	There's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the Disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 MGM version .
__label__neutral	There's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong .
__label__negative	There's not enough to sustain the comedy .
__label__neutral	There's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in Point Pleasant .
__label__positive	There's not much more to this adaptation of the Nick Hornby novel than charm -- effortless , pleasurable , featherweight charm .
__label__negative	There's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought .
__label__negative	There's plenty of style in Guillermo Del Toro's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply can't sustain more than 90 minutes .
__label__neutral	There's something deeply creepy about Never Again , a new arrow in Schaeffer's quiver of ineptitudes .
__label__negative	There's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about .
__label__negative	There's suspension of disbelief and then there's bad screenwriting ... this film packs a wallop of the latter .
__label__negative	There are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust .
__label__positive	There are a few stabs at absurdist comedy ... but mostly the humor is of the sweet , gentle and occasionally cloying kind that has become an Iranian specialty .
__label__positive	There are as many misses as hits , but ultimately , it finds humor in the foibles of human behavior , and it's a welcome return to the roots of a genre that should depend on surprises .

__label__very_positive	There are just enough twists in the tale to make it far more satisfying than almost any horror film in recent memory .
__label__very_positive	There are moments in this account of the life of artist Frida Kahlo that are among cinema's finest this year .
__label__neutral	There aren't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of Georgian Jews in Tel Aviv .
__label__positive	There are slow and repetitive parts , but it has just enough spice to keep it interesting .
__label__positive	There are times when A Rumor of Angels plays like an extended episode of Touched by an Angel -- a little too much dancing , a few too many weeping scenes -- but I liked its heart and its spirit .
__label__negative	There are touching moments in Etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject .
__label__negative	There are weird resonances between actor and role here , and they're not exactly flattering .
__label__negative	There has been much puzzlement among critics about what the election symbolizes .
__label__positive	There is a kind of attentive concern that Hoffman brings to his characters , as if he has been giving them private lessons , and now it is time for their first public recital .
__label__very_positive	There is a refreshing absence of cynicism in Stuart Little 2 -- quite a rarity , even in the family film market .
__label__neutral	There is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt Seagal's character ... performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we're not watching a double .
__label__positive	There isn't a weak or careless performance amongst them .
__label__negative	There is no entry portal in The Rules of Attraction , and I spent most of the movie feeling depressed by the shallow , selfish , greedy characters .
__label__neutral	There is no insight into the anguish of Heidi's life -- only a depiction of pain , today's version of Greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate .
__label__very_negative	There is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false .
__label__very_negative	There is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production .
__label__neutral	There was time on that second round to see the subtleties of Ramsay's portrait of grief .
__label__very_positive	These are lives worth watching , paths worth following .
__label__very_negative	These are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future .
__label__very_negative	These people wouldn't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance .
__label__negative	These spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining .
__label__negative	They felt like the same movie to me .
__label__very_positive	Think of it as a sort of comfort food for the mind .
__label__negative	Thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking .
__label__neutral	This 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it's a tad slow .
__label__neutral	This boisterous comedy serves up a cruel reminder of the fate of hundreds of thousands of Chinese , one which can only qualify as a terrible tragedy .
__label__very_positive	This bold and lyrical first feature from Raja Amari expands the pat notion that middle-aged women just wanna have fun into a rousing treatise of sensual empowerment .

__label__very_positive	This cheery , down-to-earth film is warm with the cozy feeling of relaxing around old friends .
__label__very_positive	This clever caper movie has twists worthy of David Mamet and is enormous fun for thinking audiences .
__label__positive	This concoction , so bizarre to the adult mind , is actually a charming triumph where its intended under-12 audience is concerned .

__label__very_positive	This delicately observed story , deeply felt and masterfully stylized , is a triumph for its maverick director .
__label__neutral	This dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old Hollywood saw : Evil is interesting and good is boring .

__label__positive	This examination of aquatic life off the shores of the Baja California peninsula of Mexico offers an engrossing way to demonstrate the virtues of the IMAX format .
__label__very_negative	This extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long .
__label__negative	This film's relationship to actual tension is the same as what Christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation .
__label__neutral	This film , starring Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock , is your typical ` fish out of water ' story .
__label__neutral	This film is full of rabbits .
__label__negative	This film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay .
__label__very_negative	This film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience .
__label__negative	This film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions .
__label__negative	This formulaic chiller will do little to boost Stallone's career .
__label__negative	This goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
__label__neutral	This horror-comedy doesn't go for the usual obvious laughs at the expense of cheap-looking monsters -- unless you count Elvira's hooters .
__label__very_negative	This idea has lost its originality ... and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture .
__label__neutral	This ill-fitting Tuxedo is strictly off-the-rack .
__label__positive	This insightful , Oscar-nominated documentary , in which children on both sides of the ever-escalating conflict have their say away from watchful parental eyes , gives peace yet another chance .
__label__very_positive	This is Carion's debut feature but his script and direction hums with a confidence that many spend entire careers trying to reach .
__label__positive	This is a film brimming with detail and nuance and one that speaks volumes about the ability of the human spirit to find solace in events that could easily crush it forever .
__label__very_positive	This is a film well worth seeing , talking and singing heads and all .
__label__neutral	This is a good movie in spurts , but when it doesn't work , it's at important times .
__label__negative	This is a great subject for a movie , but Hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director John Woo has built his career on .
__label__very_positive	This is a happy throwback to the time when cartoons were cinema's most idiosyncratic form instead of one of its most predictable .
__label__negative	This is a particularly toxic little bonbon , palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few .
__label__positive	This is a raw and disturbing tale that took five years to make , and the trio's absorbing narrative is a heart-wrenching showcase indeed .
__label__positive	This is a startling film that gives you a fascinating , albeit depressing view of Iranian rural life close to the Iraqi border .
__label__very_positive	This is a terrific character study , a probe into the life of a complex man .
__label__very_negative	This is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself .
__label__very_positive	This is a very fine movie -- go see it .
__label__neutral	This is an hour and a half of daydreaming .
__label__positive	This is art paying homage to art .
__label__very_positive	This is as powerful a set of evidence as you'll ever find of why art matters , and how it can resonate far beyond museum walls and through to the most painfully marginal lives .
__label__very_positive	This is cool , slick stuff , ready to quench the thirst of an audience that misses the summer blockbusters .
__label__very_positive	This is how you use special effects .
__label__negative	This is junk food cinema at its greasiest .
__label__very_negative	This isn't a `` Friday '' worth waiting for .
__label__positive	This isn't a narrative film -- I don't know if it's possible to make a narrative film about September 11th , though I'm sure some will try -- but it's as close as anyone has dared to come .
__label__very_negative	This isn't just the CliffsNotes version of Nicholas Nickleby , it's the CliffsNotes with pages missing .

__label__very_positive	This is one for the ages .
__label__very_positive	This is one of Polanski's best films .
__label__very_positive	This is one of the most visually stunning and thematically moving epics in recent memory , and in spite of numerous minor flaws , Scorsese's best in more than a decade .
__label__negative	This is pretty dicey material .
__label__neutral	This is really just another genre picture .
__label__very_positive	This is simply the most fun you'll ever have with a documentary !
__label__positive	This is such a dazzlingly self-assured directorial debut that it's hard to know what to praise first .
__label__positive	This is such a high-energy movie where the drumming and the marching are so excellent , who cares if the story's a little weak .
__label__positive	This is the best American movie about troubled teens since 1998's Whatever .
__label__positive	This is the kind of movie that used to be right at home at the Saturday matinee , and it still is .
__label__negative	This is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another .
__label__very_positive	This is what IMAX was made for : Strap on a pair of 3-D goggles , shut out the real world , and take a vicarious voyage to the last frontier -- space .
__label__neutral	This kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch .
__label__very_negative	This limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982's Tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh .
__label__very_negative	This may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer's coming-of-age .
__label__positive	This may not have the dramatic gut-wrenching impact of other Holocaust films , but it's a compelling story , mainly because of the way it's told by the people who were there .
__label__very_negative	This miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing Flatbush machismo will get it through .
__label__neutral	This movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray .
__label__very_negative	This one's weaker than most .
__label__neutral	This one does .
__label__very_negative	This overproduced and generally disappointing effort isn't likely to rouse the Rush Hour crowd .
__label__negative	This pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film's producers would be in the clink for life .
__label__very_positive	This road movie gives you emotional whiplash , and you'll be glad you went along for the ride .
__label__positive	This romantic thriller is steeped in the atmosphere of wartime England , and ably captures the speech patterns , moral codes and ideals of the 1940s .
__label__very_negative	This self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy Stealing Harvard , but he's the most obvious one .
__label__very_negative	This series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last James Bond movie .
__label__very_negative	This time Kaufman's imagination has failed him .
__label__positive	This version's no classic like its predecessor , but its pleasures are still plentiful .
__label__positive	This version incarnates the prophetic book in a way even its exacting author might admire .
__label__very_positive	This warm and gentle romantic comedy has enough interesting characters to fill several movies , and its ample charms should win over the most hard-hearted cynics .

__label__neutral	Those with an interest in new or singular sorts of film experiences will find What Time Is It There ?
__label__negative	Though Avary has done his best to make something out of Ellis ' nothing novel , in the end , his Rules is barely worth following .
__label__negative	Though Ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention .
__label__negative	Though Howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this Southern Gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter .
__label__positive	Though Mama takes a bit too long to find its rhythm and a third-act plot development is somewhat melodramatic , its ribald humor and touching nostalgia are sure to please anyone in search of a Jules and Jim for the new millennium .
__label__positive	Though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work .
__label__neutral	Though certainly original in form , Altar Boys requires a taste for Swamp Thing-type animation , doubled with a deafening score .
__label__negative	Though everything might be literate and smart , it never took off and always seemed static .
__label__neutral	Though it draws several decent laughs , it's low-cal Woody at best .
__label__positive	Though it is by no means his best work , Laissez-Passer is a distinguished and distinctive effort by a bona-fide master , a fascinating film replete with rewards to be had by all willing to make the effort to reap them .
__label__very_positive	Though of particular interest to students and enthusiast of international dance and world music , the film is designed to make viewers of all ages , cultural backgrounds and rhythmic ability want to get up and dance .
__label__negative	Though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed ... that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like Mr. Schepisi's seems skimpy and unclear .
__label__positive	Though the controversial Korean filmmaker's latest effort is not for all tastes , it offers gorgeous imagery , effective performances , and an increasingly unsettling sense of foreboding .
__label__positive	Though the film's scenario is certainly not earthshaking , this depiction of fluctuating female sexuality has two winning lead performances and charm to spare .
__label__neutral	Though the plot is predictable , the movie never feels formulaic , because the attention is on the nuances of the emotional development of the delicate characters .
__label__very_positive	Though the violence is far less sadistic than usual , the film is typical Miike : fast , furious and full of off-the-cuff imaginative flourishes .
__label__neutral	Though this film can be clumsy , its ambitions are equally -- and admirably -- uncommercial .
__label__very_positive	Thoughtful , even stinging at times , and lots of fun .
__label__very_positive	Thoughtful , provocative and entertaining .
__label__very_positive	Thrilling , provocative and darkly funny , this timely sci-fi mystery works on so many different levels that it not only invites , it demands repeated viewings .
__label__very_positive	Throwing caution to the wind with an invitation to the hedonist in us all , Nair has constructed this motion picture in such a way that even the most cynical curmudgeon with find himself or herself smiling at one time or another .
__label__very_positive	Thurman and Lewis are hilarious throughout .
__label__very_positive	Tim Allen is great in his role but never hogs the scenes from his fellow cast , as there are plenty of laughs and good lines for everyone in this comedy .
__label__positive	Tim Story's not there yet - but ` Barbershop ' shows he's on his way .
__label__positive	Time Changer may not be the most memorable cinema session but its profound self-evaluation message about our fragile existence and the absence of spiritual guidance should at least invade an abundance of mindsets
__label__neutral	To enjoy this movie's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by Jolie and Burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending .
__label__very_negative	To imagine the life of Harry Potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized Woody Allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is Kung Pow : Enter the Fist .
__label__neutral	To portray modern women the way director Davis has done is just unthinkable .
__label__neutral	To say Analyze That is De Niro's best film since Meet the Parents sums up the sad state of his recent career .
__label__positive	To the film's credit , the acting is fresh and unselfconscious , and Munch is a marvel of reality versus sappy sentiment .
__label__very_positive	Together , Tok and O orchestrate a buoyant , darkly funny dance of death .
__label__negative	Tom Green just gives them a bad odor .

__label__negative	Too close to Phantom Menace for comfort .
__label__negative	Too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining .
__label__negative	Too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise .
__label__neutral	Too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing .
__label__very_negative	Too loud , too long and too frantic by half , Die Another Day suggests that the Bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 can not fly over , tunnel under or barrel through .
__label__very_negative	Too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes .
__label__very_negative	Too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , David Arquette .
__label__neutral	Too simple for its own good .
__label__neutral	Too sincere to exploit its subjects and too honest to manipulate its audience .
__label__negative	Too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , Frank Novak's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless .
__label__negative	Too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century .
__label__negative	Topkapi this is not .
__label__very_negative	Trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere .
__label__negative	Truth to tell , if you've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there's nothing here you haven't seen before .
__label__positive	Tsai Ming-liang has taken his trademark style and refined it to a crystalline point .
__label__positive	Tuck Everlasting achieves a delicate balance of romantic innocence and philosophical depth .
__label__very_positive	Two generations within one family test boundaries in this intelligent and restrained coming-of-age drama .
__label__neutral	Two hours of melodramatic musical married to two hours of underdog sports intrigue , if the picture also shares the weaknesses of both genres , more's the pity .
__label__neutral	Ultimately , it ponders the reasons we need stories so much .
__label__neutral	Ultimately , the message of Trouble Every Day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life's stasis .
__label__negative	Ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , ` What's the point ? '
__label__negative	Uncertain in tone ... a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity Short Cuts by way of Very Bad Things .
__label__negative	Undercover Brother doesn't go far enough .
__label__very_negative	Undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters .
__label__negative	Uneasy mishmash of styles and genres .
__label__very_negative	Unfortunately , Heartbreak Hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit .

__label__positive	Highbrow self-appointed guardians of culture need not apply , but those who loved Cool as Ice have at last found a worthy follow-up .

__label__very_negative	If the first Men in Black was money , the second is small change .
__label__negative	If the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of ` there but for the grace of God , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world .

__label__neutral	If this disposable tissue has one wild card , it's John Turturro , who's simply fab as a Spanish butler with a foot fetish .
__label__neutral	If this story must be told and retold -- and indeed it must -- then The Grey Zone is to be lauded for finding a new and ingenious angle .
__label__neutral	If you're a WWF fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in A.I. , you'll probably like Rollerball .
__label__positive	If you're hard up for raunchy college humor , this is your ticket right here .
__label__neutral	If you're in the mood for a Bollywood film , here's one for you .
__label__negative	If you've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what Sex With Strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever .
__label__neutral	If you've ever wondered what an ending without the input of studio executives or test audiences would look like , here it is .
__label__negative	If you believe any of this , I can make you a real deal on leftover Enron stock that will double in value a week from Friday .
__label__positive	If you can stomach the rough content , it's worth checking out for the performances alone .
__label__very_positive	If you dig on David Mamet's mind tricks ... rent this movie and enjoy !
__label__very_positive	If you enjoy more thoughtful comedies with interesting conflicted characters ; this one is for you .
__label__positive	If your taste runs to ` difficult ' films you absolutely can't miss it .
__label__positive	Immersing us in the endlessly inventive , fiercely competitive world of hip-hop DJs , the project is sensational and revelatory , even if scratching makes you itch .
__label__negative	Impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie doesn't quite fly .
__label__very_positive	In a way , the film feels like a breath of fresh air , but only to those that allow it in .
__label__negative	In all , this is a watchable movie that's not quite the memorable experience it might have been .
__label__negative	In an effort , I suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy .
__label__very_negative	In exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if I'd been sitting naked on an igloo , Formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey .
__label__negative	In execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , Killers From Space .
__label__neutral	In his first stab at the form , Jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically .
__label__very_negative	In its best moments , resembles a bad high school production of Grease , without benefit of song .
__label__neutral	In spite of Good Housekeeping's unsavory characters and WWF mentality , this white trash War of the Roses is a surprisingly engaging film .
__label__very_negative	In the end , the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director Joe Carnahan .
__label__negative	In the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , Chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest .
__label__negative	Indifferently implausible popcorn programmer of a movie .
__label__positive	Inside the film's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out , but it's not that , it's the tension that keeps you in your seat .
__label__very_positive	Instead , he shows them the respect they are due .
__label__positive	Instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western , it's an unpretentious , sociologically pointed slice of life .
__label__very_negative	Instead of hiding Pinocchio from critics , Miramax should have hidden it from everyone .
__label__positive	Intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story's least interesting subject .
__label__very_negative	Involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters .
__label__negative	Irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater .
__label__negative	Is the time really ripe for a warmed-over James Bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ?
__label__neutral	Is this love or is it masochism ?
__label__very_negative	It's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel .
__label__positive	It's a beautiful madness .
__label__negative	It's a bit disappointing that it only manages to be decent instead of dead brilliant .
__label__negative	It's a buggy drag .
__label__very_positive	It's a charming and often affecting journey .
__label__neutral	It's a coming-of-age story we've all seen bits of in other films -- but it's rarely been told with such affecting grace and cultural specificity .
__label__negative	It's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job .
__label__neutral	It's a feature-length adaptation of one of those `` Can This Marriage Be Saved ? ''
__label__negative	It's a grab bag of genres that don't add up to a whole lot of sense .
__label__positive	It's a lovely film with lovely performances by Buy and Accorsi .
__label__positive	It's a much more emotional journey than what Shyamalan has given us in his past two movies , and Gibson , stepping in for Bruce Willis , is the perfect actor to take us on the trip .
__label__very_positive	It's a remarkably solid and subtly satirical tour de force .
__label__neutral	It's a scathing portrayal .
__label__positive	It's a scattershot affair , but when it hits its mark it's brilliant .
__label__positive	It's a stunning lyrical work of considerable force and truth .
__label__neutral	It's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center .
__label__positive	It's a work by an artist so in control of both his medium and his message that he can improvise like a jazzman .
__label__positive	It's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think .
__label__very_positive	It's also , clearly , great fun .
__label__positive	It's an offbeat treat that pokes fun at the democratic exercise while also examining its significance for those who take part .
__label__negative	It's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue .
__label__negative	It's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that's often written off as indie film naturalism .
__label__very_negative	It's as if you're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker .
__label__neutral	It's basically an overlong episode of Tales from the Crypt .
__label__negative	It's clear the filmmakers weren't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination .
__label__very_negative	It's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role .
__label__very_negative	It's dumb , but more importantly , it's just not scary .
__label__very_negative	It's everything you don't go to the movies for .
__label__positive	It's fascinating to see how Bettany and McDowell play off each other .
__label__positive	It's fun lite .
__label__positive	It's great escapist fun that recreates a place and time that will never happen again .
__label__negative	It's hampered by a Lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth .
__label__positive	It's hard to imagine Alan Arkin being better than he is in this performance .
__label__neutral	It's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong .
__label__negative	It's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and Shiner , starring Michael Caine as an aging British boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that .
__label__negative	It's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it's about as exciting as a sunburn .
__label__negative	It's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface .
__label__negative	It's just filler .
__label__very_negative	It's like watching a nightmare made flesh .
__label__positive	It's made with deftly unsettling genre flair .
__label__neutral	It's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes .
__label__negative	It's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it doesn't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks .
__label__negative	It's not that Kung Pow isn't funny some of the time -- it just isn't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all Oedekerk's impish augmentation .
__label__negative	It's not the ultimate Depression-era gangster movie .
__label__neutral	It's not without its pleasures , but I'll stick with The Tune .
__label__negative	It's of the quality of a lesser Harrison Ford movie - Six Days , Seven Nights , maybe , or that dreadful Sabrina remake .
__label__positive	It's one heck of a character study -- not of Hearst or Davies but of the unique relationship between them .
__label__positive	It's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible .
__label__very_negative	It's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions .
__label__negative	It's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up .
__label__very_positive	It's refreshing to see a girl-power movie that doesn't feel it has to prove anything .
__label__very_negative	It's slow -- very , very slow .
__label__positive	It's so good that its relentless , polished wit can withstand not only inept school productions , but even Oliver Parker's movie adaptation .
__label__neutral	It's so good that you can practically see the Hollywood ` suits ' trying to put together the cast and filmmaking team for the all-too - inevitable American remake .
__label__negative	It's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just can't get no satisfaction .
__label__negative	It's somewhat clumsy and too lethargically paced -- but its story about a mysterious creature with psychic abilities offers a solid build-up , a terrific climax , and some nice chills along the way .
__label__neutral	It's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show .
__label__very_positive	It's the chemistry between the women and the droll scene-stealing wit and wolfish pessimism of Anna Chancellor that makes this `` Two Weddings and a Funeral '' fun .
__label__neutral	It's the perfect kind of film to see when you don't want to use your brain .
__label__negative	It's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one .
__label__negative	It's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic .
__label__neutral	It's unnerving to see Recoing's bizzarre reaction to his unemployment .
__label__positive	It's worth seeing just on the basis of the wisdom , and at times , the startling optimism , of the children .
__label__positive	It all adds up to good fun .
__label__very_negative	It all drags on so interminably it's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time .
__label__very_negative	It all feels like a Monty Python sketch gone horribly wrong .
__label__negative	It appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen .
__label__neutral	It believes it's revealing some great human truths , when , in reality , it's churning ground that has long passed the point of being fertile .
__label__negative	It can't decide if it wants to be a mystery\/thriller , a romance or a comedy .
__label__very_negative	It can not be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull .
__label__very_positive	It confirms Fincher's status as a film maker who artfully bends technical know-how to the service of psychological insight .
__label__neutral	It conveys a simple message in a visual style that is willfully overwrought .
__label__positive	It deserves to be seen by anyone with even a passing interest in the events shaping the world beyond their own horizons .
__label__very_negative	It doesn't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor ... it's just plain bored .
__label__negative	It does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they're being streamed over a 28K modem .
__label__very_negative	It feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes .
__label__positive	It gets onto the screen just about as much of the novella as one could reasonably expect , and is engrossing and moving in its own right .
__label__negative	It has all the excitement of eating oatmeal .
__label__positive	It has charm to spare , and unlike many romantic comedies , it does not alienate either gender in the audience .
__label__negative	It has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death .
__label__neutral	It has the ability to offend and put off everyone , but it holds you with its outrageousness .
__label__positive	It has the charm of the original American road movies , feasting on the gorgeous , ramshackle landscape of the filmmaker's motherland .
__label__very_positive	It haunts , horrifies , startles and fascinates ; it is impossible to look away .
__label__positive	It haunts you , you can't forget it , you admire its conception and are able to resolve some of the confusions you had while watching it .
__label__very_positive	It inspires a continuing and deeply satisfying awareness of the best movies as monumental ` picture shows . '
__label__very_positive	It is amusing , and that's all it needs to be .
__label__positive	It is great summer fun to watch Arnold and his buddy Gerald bounce off a quirky cast of characters .
__label__neutral	It is the sheer , selfish , wound-licking , bar-scrapping doggedness of Leon's struggle to face and transmute his demons that makes the movie a spirited and touching occasion , despite its patchy construction .
__label__positive	It just may inspire a few younger moviegoers to read Stevenson's book , which is a treasure in and of itself .
__label__neutral	It kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others .
__label__negative	It made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen .
__label__neutral	It may seem long at 110 minutes if you're not a fan , because it includes segments of 12 songs at a reunion concert .
__label__positive	It moves quickly , adroitly , and without fuss ; it doesn't give you time to reflect on the inanity -- and the Cold War datedness -- of its premise .
__label__negative	It offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment .
__label__positive	It proves quite compelling as an intense , brooding character study .
__label__positive	It provides an honest look at a community striving to anchor itself in new grounds .
__label__very_positive	It provides the grand , intelligent entertainment of a superior cast playing smart people amid a compelling plot .
__label__positive	It seems like I have been waiting my whole life for this movie and now I can't wait for the sequel .
__label__negative	It showcases Carvey's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one's patience to get to the good stuff .
__label__very_negative	It takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as ` worse than expected , ' but Ghost Ship somehow manages to do exactly that .
__label__very_negative	It takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of Robert Forster , Anne Meara , Eugene Levy , and Reginald VelJohnson all in the same movie .
__label__negative	It takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived .
__label__very_negative	It treats women like idiots .
__label__neutral	It uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color .
__label__positive	It wants to tweak them with a taste of tangy new humor .
__label__positive	It will grip even viewers who aren't interested in rap , as it cuts to the heart of American society in an unnerving way .
__label__neutral	It will not appeal to the impatient , but those who like long books and movies will admire the way it accumulates power and depth .
__label__neutral	Its maker , Steven Spielberg , hasn't had so much fun in two decades , since he was schlepping Indiana Jones around the globe in search of a giant misplaced ashtray .
__label__negative	Its story may be a thousand years old , but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ?
__label__neutral	Jacquot's rendering of Puccini's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera .
__label__negative	Jason X is positively anti-Darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and Jason still kills on auto-pilot .
__label__positive	Jones ... does offer a brutal form of charisma .
__label__very_positive	Jose Campanella delivers a loosely autobiographical story brushed with sentimentality but brimming with gentle humor , bittersweet pathos , and lyric moments that linger like snapshots of memory .
__label__neutral	Just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time .
__label__positive	Just as moving , uplifting and funny as ever .
__label__very_negative	Just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame .
__label__negative	Just one bad idea after another .
__label__very_negative	K-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap Hollywood tension .
__label__neutral	Kept aloft largely by a comically adept ensemble .
__label__positive	Kinnear doesn't aim for our sympathy , but rather delivers a performance of striking skill and depth .
__label__positive	LaPaglia's ability to convey grief and hope works with Weaver's sensitive reactions to make this a two-actor master class .
__label__neutral	Lan Yu is at times too restrained , yet there are moments it captures the erotics of intimacy in a way that makes most American love stories look downright unfree .
__label__negative	Late Marriage's stiffness is unlikely to demonstrate the emotional clout to sweep U.S. viewers off their feet .
__label__very_positive	Leigh's film is full of memorable performances from top to bottom .
__label__negative	Less dizzying than just dizzy , the jaunt is practically over before it begins .
__label__neutral	Let's hope -- shall we ?
__label__positive	Light years \/ several warp speeds \/ levels and levels of dilithium crystals better than the pitiful Insurrection .
__label__positive	Like Leon , it's frustrating and still oddly likable .
__label__very_positive	Like Mike is a winner for kids , and no doubt a winner for Lil Bow Wow , who can now add movies to the list of things he does well .
__label__neutral	Like Mike isn't interested in recycling old cliches .
__label__neutral	Like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all .
__label__very_negative	Like being trapped at a perpetual frat party ... How can something so gross be so boring ?
__label__neutral	Like the Chelsea's denizens ... Burdette's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste .
__label__negative	Like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything's in place but something's just a little off-kilter .
__label__very_negative	Like you couldn't smell this turkey rotting from miles away .
__label__neutral	Likely to expertly drum up repressed teenage memories in any viewer .
__label__positive	Liotta put on 30 pounds for the role , and has completely transformed himself from his smooth , Goodfellas image .
__label__neutral	Long Time Dead ?
__label__very_positive	Looking aristocratic , luminous yet careworn in Jane Hamilton's exemplary costumes , Rampling gives a performance that could not be improved upon . '
__label__negative	Looks and feels like a project better suited for the small screen .
__label__very_positive	Lovely and poignant .
__label__positive	MacDowell , whose wifty Southern charm has anchored lighter affairs ... brings an absolutely riveting conviction to her role .
__label__negative	Made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss .
__label__positive	Majidi is an unconventional storyteller , capable of finding beauty in the most depressing places .
__label__neutral	Makes even the claustrophobic on-board quarters seem fun .
__label__very_negative	Makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience .
__label__neutral	Makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment ... but at least this time there's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff .
__label__very_negative	Manages to be both repulsively sadistic and mundane .
__label__neutral	Manages to be somewhat well-acted , not badly art-directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling , touching or , yikes , uproarious .
__label__very_positive	Manages to be sweet and wickedly satisfying at the same time .
__label__negative	Manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite .
__label__very_positive	Manages to transcend the sex , drugs and show-tunes plot into something far richer .
__label__neutral	Maneuvers skillfully through the plot's hot brine -- until it's undone by the sogginess of its contemporary characters , and actors .
__label__very_positive	Martin and Barbara are complex characters -- sometimes tender , sometimes angry -- and the delicate performances by Sven Wollter and Viveka Seldahl make their hopes and frustrations vivid .
__label__very_negative	Mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity .
__label__very_positive	Maud and Roland's search for an unknowable past makes for a haunting literary detective story , but LaBute pulls off a neater trick in Possession : He makes language sexy .
__label__positive	May be far from the best of the series , but it's assured , wonderfully respectful of its past and thrilling enough to make it abundantly clear that this movie phenomenon has once again reinvented itself for a new generation .
__label__negative	May reawaken discussion of the Kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen .
__label__positive	McConaughey's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script .
__label__very_positive	Michael Gerbosi's script is economically packed with telling scenes .
__label__positive	Miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness .
__label__positive	Minority Report is exactly what the title indicates , a report .
__label__neutral	Mom and Dad can catch some quality naptime along the way .
__label__very_positive	Montias ... pumps a lot of energy into his nicely nuanced narrative and surrounds himself with a cast of quirky -- but not stereotyped -- street characters .
__label__positive	Moody , heartbreaking , and filmed in a natural , unforced style that makes its characters seem entirely convincing even when its script is not .
__label__neutral	More concerned with Sade's ideas than with his actions .
__label__neutral	More maudlin than sharp .
__label__very_positive	More romantic , more emotional and ultimately more satisfying than the teary-eyed original .
__label__negative	More whiny downer than corruscating commentary .
__label__negative	Moretti's compelling anatomy of grief and the difficult process of adapting to loss .
__label__positive	Morton uses her face and her body language to bring us Morvern's soul , even though the character is almost completely deadpan .
__label__negative	Movie fans , get ready to take off ... the other direction .
__label__very_positive	Mr. Tsai is a very original artist in his medium , and What Time Is It There ?
__label__neutral	Much as we might be interested in gratuitous sexualization , Haneke has a different objective in mind -- namely the implications of our craving for fake stimulation .
__label__very_positive	My Big Fat Greek Wedding uses stereotypes in a delightful blend of sweet romance and lovingly dished out humor .
__label__very_positive	My Wife Is an Actress is an utterly charming French comedy that feels so American in sensibility and style it's virtually its own Hollywood remake .
__label__very_negative	My reaction in a word : disappointment .
__label__positive	My thoughts were focused on the characters .
__label__neutral	Nasty , ugly , pointless and depressing , even if you hate clowns .
__label__positive	Neither Parker nor Donovan is a typical romantic lead , but they bring a fresh , quirky charm to the formula .
__label__very_negative	Nelson's brutally unsentimental approach ... sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle .
__label__negative	Nervous breakdowns are not entertaining .
__label__neutral	New Best Friend's Playboy-mansion presentation of college life is laugh-out-loud ludicrous .
__label__negative	Nicks , seemingly uncertain what's going to make people laugh , runs the gamut from stale parody to raunchy sex gags to formula romantic comedy .
__label__very_positive	Nine Queens is not only than a frighteningly capable debut and genre piece , but also a snapshot of a dangerous political situation on the verge of coming to a head .
__label__negative	No aspirations to social import inform the movie version .
__label__very_negative	No one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through The Master of Disguise .
__label__neutral	No one goes unindicted here , which is probably for the best .
__label__very_positive	No screen fantasy-adventure in recent memory has the showmanship of Clones ' last 45 minutes .
__label__very_positive	No sophomore slump for director Sam Mendes , who segues from Oscar winner to Oscar-winning potential with a smooth sleight of hand .
__label__negative	No telegraphing is too obvious or simplistic for this movie .
__label__very_negative	No way I can believe this load of junk .
__label__very_negative	Nonsensical , dull `` cyber-horror '' flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting .
__label__neutral	Not a film to rival To Live , but a fine little amuse-bouche to keep your appetite whetted .
__label__very_negative	Not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions .
__label__negative	Not exactly the Bees Knees
__label__positive	Not far beneath the surface , this reconfigured tale asks disturbing questions about those things we expect from military epics .
__label__neutral	Not for the prurient or squeamish , it's a daring if overlong examination of an idolized culture , self-loathing and sexual politics .
__label__neutral	Not nearly long enough .
__label__very_positive	Not only are the special effects and narrative flow much improved , and Daniel Radcliffe more emotionally assertive this time around as Harry , but the film conjures the magic of author J.K. Rowling's books .
__label__very_positive	Not only is Undercover Brother as funny , if not more so , than both Austin Powers films , but it's also one of the smarter , savvier spoofs to come along in some time .
__label__very_negative	Not only unfunny , but downright repellent .
__label__negative	Not really bad so much as distasteful : We need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers .
__label__very_negative	Not since Freddy Got Fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through .
__label__very_positive	Not since Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa's Ran have the savagery of combat and the specter of death been visualized with such operatic grandeur .
__label__positive	Not since Tom Cruise in Risky Business has an actor made such a strong impression in his underwear .
__label__very_positive	Not the kind of film that will appeal to a mainstream American audience , but there is a certain charm about the film that makes it a suitable entry into the fest circuit .
__label__positive	Nothing's at stake , just a twisty double-cross you can smell a mile away -- still , the derivative Nine Queens is lots of fun .
__label__very_negative	Nothing in Waking Up in Reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay .
__label__neutral	Nothing is black and white .
__label__negative	Nothing is sacred in this gut-buster .
__label__neutral	Nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle .
__label__negative	Of course , by more objective measurements it's still quite bad .
__label__positive	Offers much to enjoy ... and a lot to mull over in terms of love , loyalty and the nature of staying friends .
__label__negative	Offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs ... a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm .
__label__negative	Oh come on .
__label__very_positive	Old-form moviemaking at its best .
__label__neutral	On the bright side , it contains Jesse Ventura's best work since the XFL .
__label__positive	On the heels of The Ring comes a similarly morose and humorless horror movie that , although flawed , is to be commended for its straight-ahead approach to creepiness .
__label__very_negative	On the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality .
__label__very_positive	On this tricky topic , Tadpole is very much a step in the right direction , with its blend of frankness , civility and compassion .
__label__negative	Once the 50 year old Benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back .
__label__positive	One from the heart .
__label__negative	One long string of cliches .
__label__positive	One of creepiest , scariest movies to come along in a long , long time , easily rivaling Blair Witch or The Others .
__label__very_positive	One of the best films of the year with its exploration of the obstacles to happiness faced by five contemporary individuals ... a psychological masterpiece .
__label__very_positive	One of the more intelligent children's movies to hit theaters this year .
__label__very_negative	One of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year .
__label__very_positive	One of the most significant moviegoing pleasures of the year .
__label__very_positive	One of the smartest takes on singles culture I've seen in a long time .
__label__very_positive	One of those energetic surprises , an original that pleases almost everyone who sees it .
__label__negative	One of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution .
__label__neutral	Open-minded kids -- kids who read , kids who dream -- will be comforted by the way it deals with big issues like death and destiny .
__label__negative	Or doing last year's taxes with your ex-wife .
__label__negative	Or emptying rat traps .
__label__positive	Oscar Wilde's masterpiece , The Importance of Being Earnest , may be the best play of the 19th century .
__label__negative	Outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent .
__label__neutral	Over age 15 ?
__label__negative	Overall the film feels like a low-budget TV pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube .
__label__positive	Overall very good for what it's trying to do .
__label__very_positive	Pacino is brilliant as the sleep-deprived Dormer , his increasing weariness as much existential as it is physical .
__label__very_negative	Paid In Full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from Brian De Palma's Scarface .
__label__neutral	Part Three Stooges .
__label__negative	Part low rent Godfather .
__label__very_negative	Partway through watching this saccharine , Easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected TV show .
__label__negative	Passable entertainment , but it's the kind of motion picture that won't make much of a splash when it's released , and will not be remembered long afterwards .
__label__very_positive	People cinema at its finest .
__label__negative	Perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie .
__label__negative	Plays like a volatile and overlong W magazine fashion spread .
__label__negative	Portentous and pretentious , The Weight of Water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama .
__label__neutral	Prancing his way through the tailor-made part of a male hooker approaching the end of his vitality , Jagger obviously relishes every self-mocking moment .
__label__very_positive	Preaches to two completely different choirs at the same time , which is a pretty amazing accomplishment .
__label__neutral	Pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery .
__label__very_negative	Professionally speaking , it's tempting to jump ship in January to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller .
__label__negative	Prurient playthings aside , there's little to love about this English trifle .
__label__negative	Pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer Adam Larson Broder and his co-director , Tony R. Abrams , in their feature debut .
__label__negative	Pumpkin takes an admirable look at the hypocrisy of political correctness , but it does so with such an uneven tone that you never know when humor ends and tragedy begins .
__label__neutral	Pumpkin wants to have it both ways .
__label__positive	Puts a human face on a land most Westerners are unfamiliar with .
__label__positive	Ramsay , as in Ratcatcher , remains a filmmaker with an acid viewpoint and a real gift for teasing chilly poetry out of lives and settings that might otherwise seem drab and sordid .
__label__positive	Rare Birds has more than enough charm to make it memorable .
__label__negative	Rarely has leukemia looked so shimmering and benign .
__label__negative	Rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment .
__label__positive	Reggio's continual visual barrage is absorbing as well as thought-provoking .
__label__positive	Reign of Fire looks as if it was made without much thought -- and is best watched that way .
__label__neutral	Remember the kind of movie we were hoping `` Ecks vs. Sever '' or `` xXx '' was going to be ?
__label__neutral	Returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , Sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy .
__label__positive	Richard Gere and Diane Lane put in fine performances as does French actor Oliver Martinez .
__label__neutral	Ruzowitzky has taken this mothball-y stuff and made a rather sturdy , old-fashioned entertainment out of it .
__label__negative	Sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance .
__label__positive	Sade is an engaging look at the controversial eponymous and fiercely atheistic hero .
__label__negative	Sam Mendes has become valedictorian at the School for Soft Landings and Easy Ways Out .
__label__very_negative	Samira Makhmalbaf's new film Blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal
__label__negative	Schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character .
__label__positive	Scooby Dooby Doo \/ And Shaggy too \/ You both look and sound great .
__label__very_negative	Scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence .
__label__neutral	Scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; Perdition , meanwhile , reads more like Driving Miss Daisy than GoodFellas .
__label__negative	Scorsese doesn't give us a character worth giving a damn about .
__label__positive	Seldahl's Barbara is a precise and moving portrait of someone whose world is turned upside down , first by passion and then by illness .
__label__very_positive	Seldom has a movie so closely matched the spirit of a man and his work .
__label__negative	Serving Sara doesn't serve up a whole lot of laughs .
__label__negative	Shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere .
__label__negative	Should have been someone else -
__label__neutral	Simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy .
__label__negative	Sit through this one , and you won't need a magic watch to stop time ; your DVD player will do it for you .
__label__neutral	Skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt .
__label__very_negative	Slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $ 40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ?
__label__positive	Slick piece of cross-promotion .
__label__positive	Smart , provocative and blisteringly funny .
__label__neutral	Smith is careful not to make fun of these curious owners of architectural oddities .
__label__positive	So , too , is this comedy about mild culture clashing in today's New Delhi .
__label__very_negative	So devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like XXX and Collateral Damage seem like thoughtful treatises
__label__positive	So much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie .
__label__positive	So refreshingly incisive is Grant that for the first time he'll probably appeal more to guys than to their girlfriends who drag them to this movie for the Hugh factor .
__label__positive	So unassuming and pure of heart , you can't help but warmly extend your arms and yell ` Safe ! '
__label__very_negative	So unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines .
__label__neutral	Socrates motions for hemlock .
__label__neutral	Some of it is clever , but it is never melodic \/
__label__negative	Some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , Pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny .
__label__positive	Something akin to a Japanese Alice Through the Looking Glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously .
__label__negative	Something like scrubbing the toilet .
__label__neutral	Sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn .
__label__negative	Sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest .
__label__neutral	Star Trek : Nemesis meekly goes where nearly every Star Trek movie has gone before .
__label__negative	Stealing Harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time .
__label__very_negative	Stealing Harvard is evidence that the Farrelly Bros. -- Peter and Bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with Green's half-hearted movie career .
__label__very_positive	Stephen Rea , Aidan Quinn , and Alan Bates play Desmond's legal eagles , and when joined by Brosnan , the sight of this grandiloquent quartet lolling in pretty Irish settings is a pleasant enough thing , ` tis .
__label__very_negative	Sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the WWII-era Mississippi Delta undermine this adaptation .
__label__very_positive	Still , as a visual treat , the film is almost unsurpassed .
__label__very_negative	Stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad .
__label__very_negative	Suffers from the lack of a compelling or comprehensible narrative .
__label__very_negative	Suffocated by its fussy script and uptight characters , this musty adaptation is all the more annoying since it's been packaged and sold back to us by Hollywood .
__label__negative	Sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is Rebecca Romijn-Stamos .
__label__very_negative	Taylor appears to have blown his entire budget on soundtrack rights and had nothing left over for jokes .
__label__negative	Teen movies have really hit the skids .
__label__positive	Thanks to Haynes ' absolute control of the film's mood , and buoyed by three terrific performances , Far From Heaven actually pulls off this stylistic juggling act .
__label__very_positive	Thanks to Scott's charismatic Roger and Eisenberg's sweet nephew , Roger Dodger is one of the most compelling variations on In the Company of Men .
__label__negative	That's a cheat .
__label__negative	That's pure PR hype .
__label__positive	That dogged good will of the parents and ` vain ' Jia's defoliation of ego , make the film touching despite some doldrums .
__label__positive	That is a compliment to Kuras and Miller .
__label__positive	The Chateau cleverly probes the cross-cultural differences between Gauls and Yanks .
__label__negative	The Cold Turkey would've been a far better title .
__label__neutral	The French are rather good at this kind of thing , unlike the Americans , who have a passion for Musketeers , only to spoof them .
__label__very_negative	The Iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did .
__label__positive	The Lion King was a roaring success when it was released eight years ago , but on Imax it seems better , not just bigger .
__label__very_negative	The Man From Elysian Fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves .
__label__neutral	The Movie could have been made 40 years ago , and parents ' appreciation of it may depend on whether they consider that a good thing .
__label__very_negative	The Movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ain't pretty .
__label__positive	The Son's Room is a triumph of gentility that earns its moments of pathos .
__label__positive	The Wild Thornberrys Movie is a jolly surprise .
__label__negative	The X potion gives the quickly named Blossom , Bubbles and Buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately don't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays .
__label__very_positive	The acting , costumes , music , cinematography and sound are all astounding given the production's austere locales .
__label__negative	The action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide .
__label__neutral	The actors are appealing , but Elysian Fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental .
__label__very_negative	The affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to Demme's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled Hollywood post-production effects .
__label__very_positive	The best film about baseball to hit theaters since Field of Dreams .
__label__positive	The best revenge may just be living well because this film , unlike other Dumas adaptations , is far more likened to a treasure than a lengthy jail sentence .
__label__negative	The best that can be said about the work here of Scottish director Ritchie ... is that he obviously doesn't have his heart in it .
__label__negative	The character of ZigZag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him .
__label__very_positive	The characters are interesting and often very creatively constructed from figure to backstory .
__label__positive	The continued good chemistry between Carmen and Juni is what keeps this slightly disappointing sequel going , with enough amusing banter -- blessedly curse-free -- to keep both kids and parents entertained .
__label__negative	The director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom .
__label__neutral	The documentary does little , apart from raising the topic , to further stoke the conversation .
__label__positive	The emotions are raw and will strike a nerve with anyone who's ever had family trauma .
__label__negative	The end result is a film that's neither .
__label__negative	The entire movie is about a boring , sad man being boring and sad .
__label__very_negative	The experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not .
__label__positive	The far future may be awesome to consider , but from period detail to matters of the heart , this film is most transporting when it stays put in the past .
__label__neutral	The film's almost unbearable portrait of sadness and grief transcends its specific story to speak to the ways in which need , history and presumption tangle , and sometimes destroy , blood ties .
__label__neutral	The film's essentially over by the meet-cute .
__label__very_negative	The film's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency .
__label__very_negative	The film's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style .
__label__very_positive	The film's performances are thrilling .
__label__neutral	The film's snags and stumblings are more than compensated for by its wryly subversive tone .
__label__negative	The film's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go .
__label__very_positive	The film's welcome breeziness and some unbelievably hilarious moments -- most portraying the idiocy of the film industry -- make it mostly worth the trip .
__label__negative	The film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when Carvey's Saturday Night Live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment .
__label__negative	The film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle .
__label__neutral	The film is a contrivance , as artificial as the video games Japanese teens play in a nightclub sequence , but it's an enjoyable one .
__label__negative	The film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete , as if the real story starts just around the corner .
__label__positive	The film is beautifully mounted , but , more to the point , the issues are subtly presented , managing to walk a fine line with regard to the question of Joan's madness .
__label__very_positive	The film is powerful , accessible and funny .
__label__very_positive	The film is quiet , threatening and unforgettable .
__label__negative	The film makes a fatal mistake : It asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life .
__label__positive	The film may appear naked in its narrative form ... but it goes deeper than that , to fundamental choices that include the complexity of the Catholic doctrine
__label__neutral	The film serves as a valuable time capsule to remind us of the devastating horror suffered by an entire people .
__label__neutral	The film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , Southern California locations and star power .
__label__negative	The film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip .
__label__positive	The film will play equally well on both the standard and giant screens .
__label__positive	The fly-on-the-wall method used to document rural French school life is a refreshing departure from the now more prevalent technique of the docu-makers being a visible part of their work .
__label__positive	The format gets used best ... to capture the dizzying heights achieved by motocross and BMX riders , whose balletic hotdogging occasionally ends in bone-crushing screwups .
__label__neutral	The ga-zillionth airhead movie about a wife in distress who resorts to desperate measures .
__label__very_negative	The heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence .
__label__negative	The humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant .
__label__very_negative	The humor isn't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original .
__label__neutral	The idea of 49-year-old Roberto Benigni playing the wooden boy Pinocchio is scary enough .
__label__neutral	The inhospitability of the land emphasizes the spare precision of the narratives and helps to give them an atavistic power , as if they were tales that had been handed down since the beginning of time .
__label__positive	The inspirational screenplay by Mike Rich covers a lot of ground , perhaps too much , but ties things together , neatly , by the end .
__label__positive	The jabs it employs are short , carefully placed and dead-center .
__label__neutral	The kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated .
__label__negative	The last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage American road-trip drek we've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes
__label__negative	The longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it's actually pretty good in the first few minutes .
__label__negative	The lower your expectations , the more you'll enjoy it .
__label__positive	The magic of the film lies not in the mysterious spring but in the richness of its performances .
__label__very_positive	The mesmerizing performances of the leads keep the film grounded and keep the audience riveted .
__label__neutral	The messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated Old Testament tale of Jonah and the Whale .
__label__very_positive	The most compelling Wiseman epic of recent years .
__label__very_negative	The most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take .
__label__negative	The movie's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach .
__label__positive	The movie's relatively simple plot and uncomplicated morality play well with the affable cast .
__label__negative	The movie , directed by Mick Jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting .
__label__positive	The movie does a good job of laying out some of the major issues that we encounter as we journey through life .
__label__negative	The movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts .
__label__negative	The movie is Dawn of the Dead crossed with John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second .
__label__very_positive	The movie is beautiful to behold and engages one in a sense of epic struggle -- inner and outer -- that's all too rare in Hollywood's hastier productions .
__label__neutral	The movie is for fans who can't stop loving anime , and the fanatical excess built into it .
__label__very_positive	The movie isn't just hilarious : It's witty and inventive , too , and in hindsight , it isn't even all that dumb .
__label__neutral	The movie occasionally threatens to become didactic , but it's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge .
__label__very_positive	The movie understands like few others how the depth and breadth of emotional intimacy give the physical act all of its meaning and most of its pleasure .
__label__very_negative	The moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess's home video of their baby's birth .
__label__neutral	The next generation of mob movie .
__label__very_negative	The notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy .
__label__very_positive	The old-world - meets-new mesh is incarnated in the movie's soundtrack , a joyful effusion of disco Bollywood that , by the end of Monsoon Wedding , sent my spirit soaring out of the theater .
__label__very_negative	The only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater .
__label__negative	The overall effect is less like a children's movie than a recruitment film for future Hollywood sellouts .
__label__very_positive	The performances take the movie to a higher level .
__label__positive	The piece plays as well as it does thanks in large measure to Anspaugh's three lead actresses .
__label__negative	The piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones .
__label__very_negative	The plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience's chain .
__label__positive	The primitive force of this film seems to bubble up from the vast collective memory of the combatants .
__label__negative	The problem with this film is that it lacks focus .
__label__positive	The quality of the art combined with the humor and intelligence of the script allow the filmmakers to present the biblical message of forgiveness without it ever becoming preachy or syrupy .
__label__negative	The reality of the new live-action Pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque .
__label__negative	The result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a Halloween that died .
__label__negative	The script kicks in , and Mr. Hartley's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow .
__label__very_positive	The second coming of Harry Potter is a film far superior to its predecessor .
__label__positive	The sort of film that makes me miss Hitchcock , but also feel optimistic that there's hope for popular cinema yet .
__label__positive	The special effects and many scenes of weightlessness look as good or better than in the original , while the Oscar-winning sound and James Horner's rousing score make good use of the hefty audio system .
__label__positive	The story and structure are well-honed .
__label__negative	The story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships .
__label__neutral	The stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious .
__label__positive	The structure the film takes may find Matt Damon and Ben Affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a Good Will Hunting trilogy that was never planned .
__label__positive	The subtle strength of `` Elling '' is that it never loses touch with the reality of the grim situation .
__label__negative	The talented and clever Robert Rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and didn't reserve enough for his second .
__label__neutral	The techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are Chan and Hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we can't recommend anything but a rental for The Tuxedo .
__label__very_positive	The terrific and bewilderingly underrated Campbell Scott gives a star performance that is nothing short of mesmerizing .
__label__negative	The title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well .
__label__neutral	The twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows .
__label__positive	The very definition of the ` small ' movie , but it is a good stepping stone for director Sprecher .
__label__neutral	The vintage is pure ' 87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : Fatal Attraction = don't have an affair with a nutjob ; Unfaithful = don't if you're married to one .
__label__positive	The vitality of the actors keeps the intensity of the film high , even as the strafings blend together .
__label__positive	The vivid lead performances sustain interest and empathy , but the journey is far more interesting than the final destination .
__label__positive	The volatile dynamics of female friendship is the subject of this unhurried , low-key film that is so off-Hollywood that it seems positively French in its rhythms and resonance .
__label__positive	The weight of the piece , the unerring professionalism of the chilly production , and the fascination embedded in the lurid topic prove recommendation enough .
__label__neutral	The whole is quite entertaining , but despite its virtues , there is an unsettled feeling to the film .
__label__very_negative	The words , ` Frankly , my dear , I don't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate .
__label__positive	Thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big , colorful characters .
__label__positive	There's ... tremendous energy from the cast , a sense of playfulness and excitement that seems appropriate .
__label__neutral	There's a solid woman - finding-herself story somewhere in here , but you'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it .
__label__positive	There's a wickedly subversive bent to the best parts of Birthday Girl .
__label__negative	There's enough melodrama in this Magnolia Primavera to make PTA proud yet director Muccino's characters are less worthy of Puccini than they are of daytime television .
__label__negative	There's no emotional pulse to Solaris .
__label__negative	There's not enough here to justify the almost two hours .
__label__positive	There's really only one good idea in this movie , but the director runs with it and presents it with an unforgettable visual panache .
__label__positive	There's something auspicious , and daring , too , about the artistic instinct that pushes a majority-oriented director like Steven Spielberg to follow A.I. with this challenging report so liable to unnerve the majority .
__label__neutral	There's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like Lavinia , to go the conservative route .
__label__negative	There's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging .
__label__very_negative	There are plot holes big enough for Shamu the killer whale to swim through .
__label__negative	There are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part Sliding Doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them .
__label__very_positive	There are some wonderfully fresh moments that smooth the moral stiffness with human kindness and hopefulness .
__label__neutral	There can be no other explanation .
__label__positive	There has always been something likable about the Marquis de Sade .
__label__positive	There is a fabric of complex ideas here , and feelings that profoundly deepen them .
__label__negative	There isn't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients .
__label__very_negative	There is no pleasure in watching a child suffer .
__label__positive	There is nothing outstanding about this film , but it is good enough and will likely be appreciated most by sailors and folks who know their way around a submarine .
__label__negative	There is very little dread or apprehension , and though I like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill .
__label__very_negative	There ought to be a directing license , so that Ed Burns can have his revoked .
__label__negative	There seems to be no clear path as to where the story's going , or how long it's going to take to get there .
__label__negative	They should have called it Gutterball .
__label__neutral	They takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending .
__label__negative	This Nickleby thing might have more homosexual undertones than an Eddie Murphy film .
__label__neutral	This directorial debut from music video show-off Higuchinsky is all flash .
__label__neutral	This disturbing bio-pic is hard to forget .
__label__negative	This film seems thirsty for reflection , itself taking on adolescent qualities .
__label__very_positive	This flick is about as cool and crowd-pleasing as a documentary can get .
__label__positive	This illuminating documentary transcends our preconceived vision of the Holy Land and its inhabitants , revealing the human complexities beneath .
__label__very_positive	This is a good script , good dialogue , funny even for adults .
__label__very_negative	This is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars .
__label__positive	This is a story of two misfits who don't stand a chance alone , but together they are magnificent .
__label__negative	This is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs .
__label__very_positive	This is a winning ensemble comedy that shows Canadians can put gentle laughs and equally gentle sentiments on the button , just as easily as their counterparts anywhere else in the world .
__label__neutral	This is as respectful a film as Byatt fans could hope for , though lovers of the book may wonder why it's necessary .
__label__neutral	This is her Blue Lagoon .
__label__positive	This is human comedy at its most amusing , interesting and confirming .
__label__neutral	This is it .
__label__negative	This isn't even Madonna's Swept Away .
__label__very_negative	This is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience .
__label__neutral	This is nothing but familiar territory .
__label__very_negative	This is so bad .
__label__negative	This is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing .
__label__very_positive	This is wild surreal stuff , but brilliant and the camera just kind of sits there and lets you look at this and its like you're going from one room to the next and none of them have any relation to the other .
__label__neutral	This movie is a snow emergency .
__label__negative	This movie is maddening .
__label__very_negative	This movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work .
__label__negative	This movie seems to have been written using Mad-libs .
__label__very_negative	This one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics .
__label__very_negative	This piece of Channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast .
__label__neutral	This rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that's about all it does well .
__label__very_negative	This re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against .
__label__neutral	This remake gets all there is to get out of a peculiar premise with promise : Al Pacino loathing Robin Williams .
__label__negative	This riveting World War II moral suspense story deals with the shadow side of American culture : racial prejudice in its ugly and diverse forms .
__label__positive	This surreal Gilliam-esque film is also a troubling interpretation of Ecclesiastes .
__label__positive	This tenth feature is a big deal , indeed -- at least the third-best , and maybe even a notch above the previous runner-up , Nicholas Meyer's Star Trek VI : The Undiscovered Country .
__label__negative	This time Mr. Burns is trying something in the Martin Scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again .
__label__neutral	Though Catch Me If You Can isn't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie .
__label__negative	Though Moonlight Mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama .
__label__negative	Though Perry and Hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by Jay Scherick and David Ronn , neither the actors nor director Reginald Hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .
__label__positive	Though it's become almost redundant to say so , major kudos go to Leigh for actually casting people who look working-class .
__label__positive	Though only 60 minutes long , the film is packed with information and impressions .
__label__negative	To call The Other Side of Heaven `` appalling '' would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be .
__label__neutral	To my taste , the film's comic characters come perilously close to being Amoses and Andys for a new generation .
__label__negative	To say this was done better in Wilder's Some Like It Hot is like saying the sun rises in the east .
__label__very_negative	Too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped .
__label__negative	Too much of the humor falls flat .
__label__very_negative	Too often , the viewer isn't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance .
__label__negative	Too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging ... The Isle defies an easy categorization .
__label__negative	Too slow , too long and too little happens .
__label__positive	Trademark American triteness and simplicity are tossed out the window with the intelligent French drama that deftly explores the difficult relationship between a father and son .
__label__positive	Travels a fascinating arc from hope and euphoria to reality and disillusionment .
__label__negative	Tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar .
__label__very_negative	Trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive .
__label__positive	True tale of courage -- and complicity -- at Auschwitz is a harrowing drama that tries to tell of the unspeakable .
__label__very_negative	Try as I may , I can't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , ` Thank you ! '
__label__positive	Turns potentially forgettable formula into something strangely diverting .
__label__very_positive	Two hours fly by -- opera's a pleasure when you don't have to endure intermissions -- and even a novice to the form comes away exhilarated .
__label__very_negative	Ultimately feels empty and unsatisfying , like swallowing a Communion wafer without the wine .
__label__negative	Uncommonly stylish but equally silly ... the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions .
__label__neutral	Under 15 ?
__label__negative	Unflinchingly bleak and desperate
__label__very_negative	Unfortunately , it's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies .
__label__very_positive	Unlike the speedy wham-bam effect of most Hollywood offerings , character development -- and more importantly , character empathy -- is at the heart of Italian for Beginners .
__label__very_positive	Uses high comedy to evoke surprising poignance .
__label__very_positive	Uses sharp humor and insight into human nature to examine class conflict , adolescent yearning , the roots of friendship and sexual identity .
__label__negative	Utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , Roberto Benigni's Pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film .
__label__neutral	Van Wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase ` comedy gag . '
__label__neutral	Van Wilder doesn't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like Tomcats , Freddy Got Fingered , and Slackers .
__label__negative	Velocity represents everything wrong with '' independent film '' as a commodified , sold-out concept on the American filmmaking scene .
__label__negative	Vera's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them .
__label__negative	Verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies .
__label__very_negative	Very bad .
__label__positive	Very psychoanalytical -- provocatively so -- and also refreshingly literary .
__label__negative	Very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality can't hide the giant Achilles ' heel in `` Stuart Little 2 `` : There's just no story , folks .
__label__neutral	Viewers of `` The Ring '' are more likely to remember the haunting images than the plot holes .
__label__very_positive	Visually imaginative , thematically instructive and thoroughly delightful , it takes us on a roller-coaster ride from innocence to experience without even a hint of that typical kiddie-flick sentimentality .
__label__negative	Visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide Treasure Planet entirely and completely reimagine it .
__label__neutral	Walter Hill's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama Undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity .
__label__very_positive	Warm Water Under a Red Bridge is a quirky and poignant Japanese film that explores the fascinating connections between women , water , nature , and sexuality .
__label__very_positive	We haven't seen such hilarity since Say It Isn't So !
__label__positive	We know the plot's a little crazy , but it held my interest from start to finish .
__label__neutral	We learn a lot about dying coral and see a lot of life on the reef .
__label__neutral	Weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger .
__label__very_negative	Well-nigh unendurable ... though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull .
__label__very_negative	Whaley's determination to immerse you in sheer , unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting .
__label__neutral	What's next : `` My Mother the Car ? ''
__label__positive	What's surprising about Full Frontal is that despite its overt self-awareness , parts of the movie still manage to break past the artifice and thoroughly engage you .
__label__neutral	What Time Is It There ?
__label__positive	What better message than ` love thyself ' could young women of any size receive ?
__label__positive	What distinguishes Time of Favor from countless other thrillers is its underlying concern with the consequences of words and with the complicated emotions fueling terrorist acts .
__label__very_negative	What is 100 % missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting .
__label__negative	What the director can't do is make either of Val Kilmer's two personas interesting or worth caring about .
__label__positive	What the film lacks in general focus it makes up for in compassion , as Corcuera manages to find the seeds of hope in the form of collective action .
__label__negative	What was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian .
__label__very_negative	When the film ended , I felt tired and drained and wanted to lie on my own deathbed for a while .
__label__neutral	Whenever its story isn't bogged down by idiocy involving the CIA and a lost U.S. satellite , Hunter -- starring Irwin and his American wife\/colleague , Terri -- is a movie children should enjoy .
__label__neutral	Whereas last year's exemplary Sexy Beast seemed to revitalize the British gangster movie , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it .
__label__positive	Whether writer-director Anne Fontaine's film is a ghost story , an account of a nervous breakdown , a trip down memory lane , all three or none of the above , it is as seductive as it is haunting .
__label__positive	Whether you like rap music or loathe it , you can't deny either the tragic loss of two young men in the prime of their talent or the power of this movie .
__label__neutral	Which isn't to say that it's the equal of some of its predecessors .
__label__positive	While Undisputed isn't exactly a high , it is a gripping , tidy little movie that takes Mr. Hill higher than he's been in a while .
__label__neutral	While it's nice to watch a movie that hasn't been focus-grouped into tedium , Yu's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold .
__label__neutral	While it regards 1967 as the key turning point of the 20th century , and returns again and again to images of dissidents in the streets , it's alarmingly current .
__label__positive	While its careful pace and seemingly opaque story may not satisfy every moviegoer's appetite , the film's final scene is soaringly , transparently moving .
__label__positive	While locals will get a kick out of spotting Cleveland sites , the rest of the world will enjoy a fast-paced comedy with quirks that might make the award-winning Coen brothers envious .
__label__neutral	While much of the cast has charm -- especially Allodi and Nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy .
__label__negative	While the Resident Evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these .
__label__very_positive	While the ideas about techno-saturation are far from novel , they're presented with a wry dark humor .
__label__neutral	While the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target .
__label__neutral	While the stoically delivered hokum of Hart's War is never fun , it's still a worthy addition to the growing canon of post-Saving Private Ryan tributes to the greatest generation .
__label__positive	While there's something intrinsically funny about Sir Anthony Hopkins saying ` Get in the car , bitch , ' this Jerry Bruckheimer production has little else to offer
__label__neutral	Who needs love like this ?
__label__very_negative	Why make a documentary about these marginal historical figures ?
__label__very_positive	Will amuse and provoke adventurous adults in specialty venues .
__label__very_negative	Wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by Silly Putty and Kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test Trekkie loyalty .
__label__positive	With Rabbit-Proof Fence , Noyce has tailored an epic tale into a lean , economical movie .
__label__neutral	With an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , Soderbergh's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff .
__label__negative	With its dogged Hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , Windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap .
__label__very_negative	With the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by Cedric the Entertainer as Perry's boss , there isn't a redeeming moment here .
__label__positive	With tightly organized efficiency , numerous flashbacks and a constant edge of tension , Miller's film is one of 2002's involvingly adult surprises .
__label__negative	With virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , Chelsea Walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge .
__label__positive	Without ever becoming didactic , director Carlos Carrera expertly weaves this novelistic story of entangled interrelationships and complex morality .
__label__neutral	Without the dark spookiness of Crystal Lake Camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace .
__label__positive	Woody Allen's latest is an ambling , broad comedy about all there is to love -- and hate -- about the movie biz .
__label__negative	Works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them .
__label__positive	Worth watching for Dong Jie's performance -- and for the way it documents a culture in the throes of rapid change .
__label__neutral	Wouldn't one about their famous dad , author of Death in Venice , etc. , be more valuable ?
__label__very_positive	Writer-director's Mehta's effort has tons of charm and the whimsy is in the mixture , the intoxicating masala , of cultures and film genres .
__label__positive	Writer\/director Joe Carnahan's grimy crime drama is a manual of precinct cliches , but it moves fast enough to cover its clunky dialogue and lapses in logic .
__label__neutral	Writer\/director Mark Romanek spotlights the underlying caste system in America .
__label__very_positive	Yakusho and Shimizu ... create engaging characterizations in Imamura's lively and enjoyable cultural mix .
__label__neutral	Yes , Ballistic is silly .
__label__very_negative	Yes , dull .
__label__positive	You'll gasp appalled and laugh outraged and possibly , watching the spectacle of a promising young lad treading desperately in a nasty sea , shed an errant tear .
__label__very_positive	You don't have to know about music to appreciate the film's easygoing blend of comedy and romance .
__label__very_negative	You really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this .
__label__positive	You will emerge with a clearer view of how the gears of justice grind on and the death report comes to share airtime alongside the farm report .
__label__negative	You won't like Roger , but you will quickly recognize him .
__label__neutral	You won't miss its messages , but you'll be entertained as well .
__label__negative	You wonder why Enough wasn't just a music video rather than a full-length movie .
__label__negative	Zaidan's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight .
__label__positive	Zhang ... has done an amazing job of getting realistic performances from his mainly nonprofessional cast .
__label__negative	\/ But Daphne , you're too Buff \/ Fred thinks he's tough \/ And Velma - wow , you've lost weight !
__label__neutral	` A ' for creativity but comes across more as a sketch for a full-length comedy .
__label__very_positive	` De Niro ... is a veritable source of sincere passion that this Hollywood contrivance orbits around . '
__label__very_positive	` Easily my choice for one of the year's best films . '
__label__neutral	` They ' begins and ends with scenes so terrifying I'm still stunned .
__label__very_positive	`` Mostly Martha '' is a bright , light modern day family parable that wears its heart on its sleeve for all to see .
__label__neutral	`` The Ring '' is pretty much an English-language copy of the film that inspired it , and it carries the same strengths and flaws .
__label__very_negative	`` The Time Machine '' is a movie that has no interest in itself .
__label__negative	a by-the-numbers patient\/doctor pic that covers all the usual ground
__label__negative	a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes .
__label__positive	a quiet , pure , elliptical film
__label__neutral	columns from Ladies Home Journal ...
__label__very_negative	comes off like a rejected ABC Afterschool Special , freshened up by the dunce of a Screenwriting 101 class .
__label__very_positive	deliriously funny , fast and loose , accessible to the uninitiated , and full of surprises
__label__positive	does paint some memorable images ... , but Makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters
__label__neutral	essentially an exceptionally well-written , well-edited , well-directed , well-acted , bald rip-off of Aliens .
__label__positive	if you are an actor who can relate to the search for inner peace by dramatically depicting the lives of others onstage , then Esther's story is a compelling quest for truth .
__label__neutral	is not easy .
__label__negative	it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so
__label__negative	just not campy enough
__label__neutral	may not have generated many sparks , but with his affection for Astoria and its people he has given his tale a warm glow .
__label__neutral	should be seen at the very least for its spasms of absurdist humor .
__label__positive	the film tunes into a grief that could lead a man across centuries .
__label__very_positive	what really makes it special is that it pulls us into its world , gives us a hero whose suffering and triumphs we can share , surrounds him with interesting characters and sends us out of the theater feeling we've shared a great adventure .

__label__positive	It was exactly what I needed. Clean quiet and good location
__label__positive	Loved the proximity to the ocean and restaurants. We really liked the one bedroom suite and two bathroom set-up. Had we been there longer we would have used the kitchen which was fully functional. The room was quiet, the parking was suitable, and the breakfast, although not a hot one, was quite satisfactory. The one suggestion would be to have coffee available earlier for the early birds. Thanks, we enjoyed our stay and will be back!
__label__neutral	We were looking for an inexpensive 2-night stay in the Albany/Schenectady area, and this Days Inn filled the bill very well thanks to a discounted rate.

__label__neutral	We were given the worst rooms in the house. I believe it's because we booked through Expedia. We had a family of 7 in two rooms, both rooms were handicap versions, no tubs for kids, and located at extreme opposite ends of the hotel. They claimed it was due to being extremely full, despite booking months in advance and giving them two warnings of our arrival 24 hrs prior and morning of. Handicap rooms were totally inappropriate with small children. They made zero effort to put us close together. Do not recommend for families. Dining room is too formal, and they do not allow children in the lounge. Room service wasn't perfect. Asked for wine with 4 glasses and a bucket of ice. They brought 3 glasses and no ice. They charged a late evening service charge for room service before 8 pm. Won't return I'm afraid.

__label__neutral	Ut fra det vi hadde lest om hotellet i beskrivelse og kundekommentarer ble vi meget skuffet. Det var langt fra noe juniorsuite, men en stor rom. Badet var ikke avfotografert og vi var derfor skeptiske, men uten grunn. Dette var ok.Det var beskrevet 2 svmmebasseng og barnebasseng (svmmebasseng var en forutsetning for oss da vi bestilte). Det var et basseng som ikke hadde/hadde anledning til solsenger og l delvis i skyggen pga trr/palmer. Fotoet fra hotellet viste feil. S godt som ingen gjester brukte det ene bassenget. Takterrassen var meget bra. Nr vei til en flott strand og et koselig sentrum. Det var ogs beskrevet at hotellet kunne hente bringe fra/til flyplassen (dette sjekket vi p mail til hotellet fr vi reiste). De kunne bestille taxi... Beskrevet gratis avis. Ja - i respesjonen. Klimanlegget var fast stilt p 19 gr.C. Ble ppekt 2 ganger fra oss uten bli ordnet. Samme tannglass - uten bli vasket - i 14 dager.. Det sparatet sitteomrdet var 2 stoler p rommet, ved sengen.. Kjleskapet p rommet var varmt. Vi fikk beskjed om at det skulle vre slik, men at vi mtte sette inn noe kaldt, s ville det bli bra. Det stemte ikke...Dessverre kommer vi ikke til reise tilbake. Vi anbefaler Hotels.com justere beskrivelsen. Med andre forventninger kunne nok oppholdet blitt greit.

__label__very_negative	I didn't stay here, but came in with a coupon for 28 and was denied. The clerk said it could not be used until June, even though the expiration on it was 4/30/11. I mentioned the 31.99 price they have posted on the highway and outside the hotel, and he said it was for construction workers.
__label__very_negative	Arrived and the elevator was broken. My wife has a bad knee and we had to climb two flights of stairs to the third floor to get to our room. Nobody offered to help us carry our luggage or provided any type of amenities for the inconvenience. Not what we expected from a La Quinta property.

__label__positive	Hotel was very nice and clean. Breakfast was good could of had a little more variety thou. Mainly fruit and cereals. Only had scrambled eggs, sausage links, and pre made small pancakes not even fresh ones was only choice for hot food. Had bagels and bread to toast also. Located next to Dave and Busters and when it closed there was lots of yelling and reving of car engines and carrying on for atleast 30 minutes or more when we was trying to sleep. Not sure if it was an isolated happening or its every night that way. Then there was a generator that ran all night long in the next parking lot which kept us from being able to sleep well Saturday night. Hotel and staff was all very nice but the surrounding noise made it a very long night with very little sleep due to all the noise outside our hotel window. Will look for another location next time forsure.
__label__neutral	Great Jacuzzi tubs Great staff, really nice customer service. I really felt like I was being taken care of. I got a a penthouse suite for a regular room rate one night. Beautiful balcony views, great jacuzzi tub. My fireplace wasnt working so they sent up a bottle of wine! Great bar downstairs-Jake's grill, they have an excellent happy hour.
__label__very_positive	On the Esplanade side of New Orleans' French Quarter, the Lamothe House is in what I like to call the vampire district, and I mean that in a charming, Anne Rice way. It's two blocks from French Street, where the best blues-jazz can be heard and with a cool local crowd. It's also just far enough away from the insanity of the Bourbon St scene to make it accessible without the nuisance. The only drawback is that it is about 2.25 miles from the Superdome, Conv. Center, etc. The building is well-preserved by 18th century NOLA standards (a city built on cotton bales for soil stability), but I would not recommend it for children. Elderly and handicapped should stay on the ground floor, but not stay away. This is a lovers' hotel.

__label__very_positive	Great
__label__very_positive	the stay was amazing and definitely worth the price big room and ac worked perfectly it was nice and quiet a terrific trip
__label__neutral	Stayed Sunday through Tuesday. Valet parking is very unorganized causing congestion and long wait times coming and going. Line at check-in at 3 pm was horribly long, so left to get dinner. Line still long when we got back 2 hours later. Then there were ridiculously long lines the entire time for elevators in Tower 3. We actually found and used the service elevator after the first day. Both swimming pools and beach were closed first day because of winds, which were maybe 10 miles an hour. Room smelled like a sewer entire visit, and bathroom tiles/shower had mold and stains. Breakfast at the buffet was the only highlight of the visit.
__label__neutral	Not a country inn and suites. Maybe they get it together after the redo
__label__very_positive	This hotel has it all and more. You won't be disappointed with anything. Food, beautiful well-appointed rooms, very friendly staff, security, wonderful pool and exercise area, absolutely the BEST of the BEST. Price includes nice buffet dinner, great buffet breakfast, 3 drinks w/ dinner makes this hotel an exceptional bargain.

__label__positive	Great hospitality,wonderful experience.
__label__neutral	for the price of the room free breakfast should be served
__label__positive	Nothing special, but it was clean, comfortable and about 5 blocks from the boardwalk in a quieter, residential area. I would stay there again. My only interaction with staff was check in and check out, but they were friendly and extremely accommodating.
__label__very_positive	Fastest and simplest hotel check in ever! Nice Job!
__label__neutral	Only issue was that I requested a non smoking room, but I got a room which clearly has had smokers in it before. I'm sure if I would've complained they would have fixed the issue, so it's not a big deal. It was more on my end not Caring enough to complain. Other than that the place is good. Wouldn't mind staying here again.

__label__very_positive	Everything was perfect. They made the ballroom into a winter wonderland. Teresa helped me through the line to get me a plate of the delicious food and also made sure we had to go boxes to take with us afterward.
__label__neutral	We had 3 of us and they had no queen rooms available!! Beds were small! Breakfast was not included as written! Breakfast was a 14. Voucher and for only 2 people, not 3! So, we did not use it at all! Went elsewhere to eat! Also, when Maid service came in room to make beds and such ... They didn't leave fresh towels or new coffee packets!

My kids had been misbehaving a lot right around the time of our trip to Disney world, so I told them I was canceling the vacation to Disney World and we were going somewhere else instead. I drove them to this place and it scared them straight. The place is old, scary and dirty.

The room was comfortable and well-appointed, though I thought the bathroom design could have been better. Staff were helpful and pleasant.
__label__very_positive	My fiance and I needed a place to stay for two nights before heading back home. My room was clean, spacious, and fresh smelling. The staff was AWESOME!. The lady at the desk got us a room quickly and the person cleaning made sure we had everything we needed. The customer service here was greatly appreciated. We will stay again...Thank you for leaving us a 5 star review. It is always good to hear that our team provided it great service. Hope you had a safe trip home, see you on your next trip.

__label__very_positive	Although the hotel is in the middle of nowhere, I will definitely book a reservation with them in the future should the need arise. The room was clean, well-lit, and comfortable. The mini-kitchenette was well appointed. The shower was adequate. The heating and the AC worked perfectly. The bed was quite comfortable, although I wish they has supplied more firm pillows than they did. Room service was quite satisfactory. The complimentary breakfast is a nice amenity. I just wish hotels would stop advertising on Expedia that they have safes when my room did not in fact have a safe.

__label__positive	Weekend getaway
__label__very_positive	Room was wonderfully-appointed, quiet and very clean. Beds were extremely comfortable, and the room contained furniture for office work as well as a fridge, microwave, leisure couch and table. Innovative lighting made it possible for someone to read or move around the room without disturbing anyone else in the room. Breakfast in the morning included a large variety of hot and cold foods and the staff was extremely attentive and helpful. We would love to stay at this property again.

__label__very_positive	This was trip 10 and it was amazing as usual the wonderful staff is what's keeps us going back! We stayed in a RTT in the Excellence Club well worth the extra money. The food was great we didn't have a bad meal, we have been home less than a week and we are already planning our next visit.
__label__positive	It was reasonably priced and near Presque Isle. The best of both worlds! Very quiet!
__label__very_negative	I will give it convienient
__label__positive	The registration clerk was very friendly and helpful. We were facing the traffic, with a traffic light at the corner, and it was noisy. The bathroom was tiny and wouldn't be suitable for larger persons. The price was low, the room was adequate, the breakfast was minimal but O.K.
__label__very_negative	The hotel was only 43 a night and it was worth half that. Disgusting! It smelled, guest were noisey throughout the night, and dirty. I only chose it because the hotels.com rep said it was a great hotel. Will NEVER take their word again.

__label__very_positive	No Surprises
__label__positive	Late night incoming flight and needed a nice place close to the airport. After midnight check-in, overnight clerk had multiple face piercings and appeared very unprofessional, wasn't sure if he worked there or was just hanging out. Room was comfortable and quiet, bathroom floor needed cleaning along with the shower. Overall was nice place to sleep after a very late flight.
__label__positive	Couldn't be better situated if you want to sample the delights of the city. A block from the clubs on Frenchman, and just above the Quarter, easy stroll to Treme, or over to Bywater, downtown. The housekeeping staff is SO friendly and fun, and they do a stellar job. I had a downstairs room, and in this old structure, you can hear every footstep, so if that bothers you, request one upstairs. Would/will return the next time I want to enjoy New Orleans

__label__positive	We like to try different districts when we go to Paris The Melia is in such a great area and the room was large and overlooking a courtyard with an oak tree. The bathroom had a dream tub. We always stay in four stars and this two week vacation in 4 different locations ended with a night in this, the best hotel of the stay.
__label__very_negative	The hotel was very mediocre - even less than what you would expect from a Super 8. Also, upon check-in, they assessed me an extra 15.00 fee for my dog even though that fee was not disclosed on Hotels.com or the Super 8 hotel interconnect on Policies that is part of the Hotels.com website. Thus the hotel stay turned out to be an 80. a night deal which is more than the amount a rational person would want to pay to stay at a Super 8.
__label__negative	Bad need of maintenance (phone chargers fall out of the plugs due to loose electric outlets, mounted fixtures loose due to poor maintenance ie towel holder). Made reservations for three, only two towels in bathroom had to request more. Rooms dirty, old coffee filter still in coffee pot, pen cap and unused condom left under bed. Ice Box needed defrosting. Even though price should reflect some discrepancies you would expect more.
__label__very_negative	In your discription, it had a continental breakfast, it did not. It was a grab and go, I was not impressed. Had I known I would not have choice this hotel. The plumbing squealed very loud, givings us headaches. There was no kitchen amenities and no cleaning people or fresh towels for either night. Room was too small even one person.
__label__negative	pas a la hauteur du prix. une chambre ou il fait froid en entrant, une salle de bain ou il fait encore plus froid, une clim reversible qui est pourtant deja poussee a son maximum et q u il me faut eteindre pour esperer dormir vu le bruit. une tache sur le drap, mais surtout le vrai point qui m a gene: une cuvette des toilettes avec plein de traces de liquide sec... pas du tout ragoutant. le petit dejeuner etait lui classique et honnete, le pain au chocolat bien chaud. 131 euros pour ca, honnetement ca ne les merite pas.

__label__negative	Busted room windows, carpet worn away from bathroom threshold exposing tacks pointing upward, printer for guests non-functional resulting in multiple trips to nearby paid printing, breakfast sorely lacking in...well...breakfast, had to return to front desk EVERYDAY to have door cards reprogrammed, large open area next to kitchen obviously for a dining table but no table which is odd for a 2 bedroom extended stay with kitchen, directly across street from hospital resulting in late night sirens most nights, although the 2 bedroom, 2 bath room is spacious enough for 6+ people (states this on their website also) the included utensils are no more than a single room for one person. Staff was friendly but not apologetic for the shortcomings, just grown used to it I think. Rooms were comfortable.
__label__very_positive	The room was great! Lots of space, good full-length mirrors, and an excellent bed. The closet could have been better. It was very shallow and needed to be deeper for clothes to hang properly.
__label__very_positive	Staff was very helpful. Hotel was clean. we had to call the front desk for a issuse with our safe and they were at our door in seconds.

__label__positive	We had a new room(only 3 months old) but the bathroom sink kept stopping up and they couldn't fix it. Maid service could have been better, not consistent or thorough. Food and drinks were great throughout, since we had all inclusive we used as much as we could. Wifi was included for 2 devices but we kept loosing signal and got charged international data by our mobile service. Could have had more activities at the pools, plus they charged us 5 each to play tennis even though we were on the all inclusive plan. We decided to take the time share presentation only because we got the right salesperson (Blanca) who ended up giving us 6 excursions instead of the resort credit after some negotiations we with her. The presentation was actually good and they didn't push us to hard to purchase.
__label__positive	Pleasant stay with minor glitch
__label__negative	Disgusting
__label__positive	Everything was as expected from the booking information, the staff who checked me in were very helpful and friendly. Room was small but fine for a single night stay. Room and bathroom were clean if a little worn. No issues with late check in and early check out. Only complaint was that when I arrived the room was incredibly warm and stuffy, and even cranking the fan didn't really alleviate the humidity in the room. Was not intolerable, and the bed was next to the air unit which helped.
__label__very_negative	Not what expected
__label__positive	Krefeldt var en chock. Sllan har jag sett en s ful och trist stad.
__label__neutral	Parkside Inn looks nice and inviting from the outside, however the rooms are fair at best. I think they were going for cabin style rooms, but they did a poor job. The baseboards were plain wood, pulling away from the walls in several areas. Cheap paneling on a couple of the walls and mismatched furniture. Just a rod to hang clothes in the room, no closet. NO A/C! It was in the 80's during the day and still warm at night. There was a fan in the room that only worked on high and literally sounded like a propeller airplane running in the room. LOUD! We had to sleep with the windows open with people walking right past our bed, so no privacy. For the good points, the indoor pool was ok, and the free breakfast was decent and the dining room was ok. All in all, the room was much cheaper than other hotels in the area, but you get what you pay for.

__label__positive	I stayed at the Garibaldi so that I could attend a funeral. The staff are excellent and responsive to all request. My air conditioner had a problem with it draining and had leaked on the floor. I spoke to Luigi (the owner of the hotel) and he had it repaired in less than 2 hours. The breakfast buffet is good. I like being able to make my coffee.
__label__negative	This hotel is NOT located in Monroeville as advertised on the site. It is in Murrysville. The room was ok but the building and the surrounding area looks run down. The price was reasonable but I usually expect more quality from a Super 8 than is at this location.
__label__positive	Very pleased with room condition. There was a bug but only one. My only disappointment was with the breakfast bar. Canned fruit cocktail instead of fresh fruit, high fructose carbs and cereals. The first morning eggs were offered but none left 1/2 hr prior to buffet closing. The second morning was sausage gravy - not loved by everyone and certainly about as unhealthy of an offering one could find. Hard boiled eggs were hard as rocks.
__label__negative	Okay.
__label__positive	Very Nice Condo
__label__very_positive	Our room was perfect for me, my teen daughter and our 15 pound dog. It was upscale for a very reasonable price and dog fee is only 10 dollars. Great area as well. We will stay here often on our way from Wisconsin to Texas to visit other daughters. Staff was also extremely accommodating and room very clean. Pool looked very nice but we decided to relax in our room instead.
__label__positive	ok hotel
__label__very_negative	Our family was in town and stayed for a funeral. We had multiple rooms in this hotel over the weekend of 9/10/16-9/11/16. One of the beds in my room had dirty linen on the bed which was completely made up. The other comforter had seamen stains all over it. The front desk was of little to no help. Gave a half hearted apology and stated we do our best but don't catch everything.Prior to check out on Sunday, overheard 2 members of housekeeping in a room and one told the other, It looks clean, just make it up and lets move on.
__label__very_negative	For a quieter drink in the area, go to the bar on the 8th floor
__label__very_negative	The room was efficient but the housekeeping wasn't good in my opinion ! The refrigerator was extremely loud annoying but the worst the door situation! You would think the door was locked but you pushed hard on it and it would open! (I'll assume it was the room we had). Having unsecured locking system was not the most favorable... More
__label__very_positive	Excellent place to stay.
__label__very_negative	I arrived on my vacation that i booked months in advance to lay by the pool and do nothing for a week. The pool happened to be closed.. nobody told me this.. even when I checked in.didn't find out till I went down in my bathing suit. Then they didn't want to refund me so I could stay elsewhere. Ridiculous
__label__very_positive	Nice clean hotel. Use it when I have to stay overnight in Tucson before or after a flight. Really liked the upgraded rooms. Will definitely stay again. Stayed at the Double tree on the way home this time because of the way my points worked out and there is NO comparison. I was wishing I was at Hampton Inn again.
__label__very_positive	The swimming pool was clean and the breakfast excellent
__label__very_positive	Nice room and employees

__label__very_positive	This by far is the best customer service we have received from a hotel. Yes, it is a little expensive for the average income family, but so worth it! We called ahead of time to see if we could park in the parking garage before our actual check in time. They said absolutely and when you arrive, we will see... More
__label__very_negative	The only kind person was the woman that cleaned the room. The 2 owners, husband and wife, were absolutely horrible. Their attitudes and customer service skills make me believe they get no return business. I do not recommend anyone to support or subject themselves to these conditions. Your trip will be effected in a negative way.
__label__very_negative	As I said terrible. Filthy rooms, dirty linen, mold on bath walls, paint plaster falling of walls in room. Dingy towels, broken refrigorator, eletrocal outlet not working and very poor service from staff. Propety not up kept. Thugs hanging put around building and in lobby area. Get better service at a neighborhood mission or shelter. I would not recomend anyone to stay there, even as a last resort.
__label__very_positive	The breakfast is pretty nice and they have an amazing pool. Great way to fight the jet lag.

__label__very_positive	every aspect of our one-night stay here was superb. cannot say enough about how helpful and attentive the young man at the desk was (Veon). we got an easy-going vibe from staff and Manager (Tammy), but everything was in order, not an easy task.
__label__very_positive	Amazing B B!
__label__very_negative	Hotel has a very strange odor.  Rooms are quite dated and need major cleaning.  The shower was full of mold/mildew and the bathroom outlet did not work.  The bed and pillows are extremely uncomfortable and I am uncertain as to why rooms have sliding glass doors opening to a parking lot.  This is a major safety risk and moreover not very good soundproofing... you may as well have slept on the highway outside the room.

__label__positive	Our stay was ideal at The Plaza! Close to Fremont Street. Easy Access to Valet. Great folks at the hotel are always very helpful. South Tower is easily accessible.
__label__very_positive	As an airport hotel, it's hard to beat. It was quiet, everything worked well, including the Wi-Fi with the exception of the hair dryer which did not work. Good alarm clock in the room and the wake up call was punctual.
__label__neutral	Older motel showing its age. Room was average clean, the AC worked well but a bit noisy. The front desk person was very helpful. Ask for a room away from the street and the pool on the second level (no elevator).
__label__very_positive	Like family.
__label__very_positive	Beautiful location I wanted to stay longer
__label__very_positive	When we checked in we were mistakenly sent to a room that hadn't been cleaned yet. Immediately the staff switched us to an upgraded room and made sure we were happy with everything. They were truly upset they had sent us to the uncleaned room and did everything and more to make it right. Good customer service will keep us coming back! The room was beautiful and comfortable!
__label__neutral	Ok overpriced hotel
__label__positive	If you're like me and travelling on a tighter budget, I would recommend Tidewater Inn. It was, overall, an enjoyable experience. The staff at the reception were courteous and helpful. Our room met our expectations.

The staff was super friendly. The pool was a little warmer this time. However breakfast was the same both days

__label__positive	Holiday Inn Hesperia, CA.
__label__very_positive	We were there for a nearby bike race. The area is busy strip mall, shops, Starbucks nearby. The hotel was nicer than expected. Pool is very big (for a hotel). Hotel is older, what was a resort, converted and remodeled. While it has a 2.5 star rating I don't know why. Restaurant, lounge and pool on-site should make it a 3 star. Good business hotel, although that is not what we were there for.
__label__neutral	The hotel itself was great. This is the second time we've stayed here, and both times I've booked through Hotels.com. Upon check in, we were told that our room was not paid for by Hotels.com requiring me to pay yet again. The front desk has always been very understanding, but getting the charges off my credit card are a nightmare. Still waiting for the most recent charge to be removed. The breakfast bar was sub-par. Unfortunately, their newly hired breakfast bar attendant did not come to work and the front desk clerk was trying to do multiple tasks resulting in a food choices not refilled, sugar and creamer non-existent, etc. This was an unfortunate incident and should not be held against the hotel.
__label__very_positive	Just like Home
__label__neutral	A/C smelt moldy and wasnt very cold. Walls were damaged and needed some remodeling
__label__positive	Location, Location, Location. It's minutes away from everything worth seeing in Istanbul. The hotel staff are just great, they helped us with everything and even arranged tours at an adequate rate. Will definitely stay there again. The pub downstairs is also great for a relaxed drink in the afternoon
__label__very_positive	Propre, calme, confortable, service... Tout m'a plus que satisfait un prix abordable. Une mention spciale pour le petit dej. J'y reviendrai
__label__neutral	We've stayed at the Plaza our last 4 trips, and this was by far the worst experience. The front desk was very robotic like unwelcoming, and rude and when asking for a manager they were no better very uncaring.The website still lists they're poker room unlike any other which we've come to enjoy and is the main reason we frequent the plaza and they no longer have a poker room much less live poker games.
__label__very_positive	It's nice to feel right at home while vacationing! This property is clean, comfortable and well maintained. The owners are often seen chatting with guests-they are so friendly and really care about their property and their guests. The location is perfect! I'll never stay anywhere else in Hampton Beach!
__label__very_positive	Great Hotel on way to UWP
__label__positive	Faded hotel could use some upkeep.
__label__very_positive	Clean and comfortable, nice hotel for its price range, good location--we enjoyed our 2-night stay. FYI, the outdoor pool is open until 11 p.m. poolside rooms are fine if you are vacationing with teens or night owls, but if you have toddlers/young children or anyone who prefers to go to bed early in your party, you may want to request a room on another side of the hotel--pool party noise kept us up late the first night (and we WERE the pool party noise the second night when we weren't worn out from traveling!) Several choices for breakfast (make-your-own waffles, biscuits and gravy, eggs, sausage, doughnuts, cereal, toast, yogurt, apples, fruit juice, milk, etc.) and you can get small discounts on tickets to several attractions if you purchase vouchers at front desk. The only very minor service/room condition complaints we had were that one of the electrical outlets was pulling out of the wall, that we had to call to request replacement shampoo/conditioner the second night, and also when we requested pool towels shortly before pool closing, we were asked to go to the front desk to get them, as they could not bring them down to the pool towel cabinet for us at that time (no big deal unless you're already wet from the pool, of course!) Overall, our three-room party of extended family had a good experience, and would stay again.
__label__neutral	Not bad for an inn. Especially for the price
__label__neutral	Have stayed here many times and really like this place. The staff - particularly in the restaurants - is wonderful.
__label__positive	Worth the view. Gorgeous! Loved our room. Friendly staff. Food could be a little better for the price.
__label__very_negative	We arrived late and was greeted by a gentleman that was extremely unfriendly .... Room was very small and smelled disgusting...no warm water for showers.... Breakfast was even more disgusting... Bagels were wet hard and moldy.... Front desk woman was rude.. Never asked how r stay was...never again!
__label__very_positive	I loved my stay at Jacksonville Plaza. Everyone was so nice and welcoming. Whenever I come back to Jacksonville, this will always be my hotel of choice.
__label__very_positive	Would stay at again. Everyone was very friendly. The breakfast was very good. A nice verity of food to pick from. And the breakfast attendant was very nice and helpful.
__label__very_positive	Great location in Alexandria. Very kid and dog friendly. Small but lovely indoor swimming pool. Eclectic boutique. Afternoon wine tasting in the cozy lobby is nice touch. Great value. Highly recommended.

__label__negative	The area seems pretty safe. The room was nasty. Dust everywhere. Grime was visible in the bathroom. Bathroom door was broken. Lock bar on front door was broken. No elevator. You have to carry your bags up stairs. The rates are low so I guess we got what we paid for.
__label__positive	Good place for our overnight stay after arriving at Ft. Pierce airport and departure the next morning.

__label__very_negative	The hotel was quit run down. 5 night stay and they never changed the sheets. Towels were very small and not sure they changed those either. They were all white, but different patterns -there was one with flowers in the pattern and that towel was there every single day. Called for shuttle from airport - phone just kept ringine - no answer for 5 tries. Once we got the shuttle call thru - took 40 minutes and that van was quite dirty too. The soda machine only takes exact change there is no coin changer. Front desk wouldnt make change. The hairdryer was really old and came off the whole box that holds it fell off the wall.

__label__very_negative	Back in town again, parking lot redone finally. Hotel really needs a wake up call, walls dirty, floors stained, staff employee that checked me in was awful. Room furniture really needs cleaning, bathrooms not cleaned very well, then the end all their was a bug in my bed!!! I don't sleep with bugs.
__label__positive	I have stayed here on two trips and will be booking a third. When all I need is a clean, safe room to stay in, this fit my needs nicely. I don't want to pay exorbitant rates when my only need is just somewhere to sleep and shower. The staff has been efficient and so friendly. I would highly recommend this hotel for the business person who just needs the basics

__label__very_positive	Cool, historic building close to the art museum and bjcc. We had a king bed in a large corner room, everything was clean and comfortable. The only complaint we had was some loud generator or leaf blower coming on one morning periodically.
__label__positive	Stayed overnight with the kids for a one night getaway. This hotel really brings me back to the old Holidome. There was so much to do. The only drawback was that we stayed on a Saturday night and there was so many events going on that the place was loud and packed, but the kids loved it. Not the place for a relaxing stay, but really great for actvice kids!
__label__negative	won't stay again
__label__positive	Got a good deal during low season. The stay was comfortable, and more than what we expected. We really enjoyed our stay at Angler's Inn. If a good and strong WiFi connection is your priority then you may be disapointed. Otherwise, it is a nice place to stay, and we would stay there again.

I call the desk to complain they said the would talk with to them, I ask to be moved, but the said we will first talk with them. Found desk call back and said they were getting ready for bed this was 8:30 it was 2:00am when the went to sleep. So I had a mad night.
__label__negative	Would have been a better trip. But between the kids running up and down hallway and slamming doors. And the drunks talking loud and slamming doors at 1:30 in the morning. I will not be staying here anymore.
__label__neutral	Our shower drain was soooo slow that you had to shower fast so it would not overflow, by the elevator there was a broken mirrored sliding door that sat on some folded up chairs the 4 days we stayed there.

__label__very_positive	I usually stay at the holiday inn, but they were booked, so I decided to give this hotel a shot.  One problem I did have was with the shuttle service of the other super 8 in town.  After asking them if they were my super 8, since there are apparently 2 in the ohare area, when i asked where thier pool was they said they didnt have one.  I realized that I was at the wrong one, and that the driver had lied to me.  Long story short...MAKE SURE YOU HOP IN THE RIGHT SHUTTLE BUS...the one that says ELK GROVE on it.  However once I got to the right hotel I couldnt be more pleased.  The rooms were very clean and the hotel actually looks like most of the holiday inn's ive stayed at.. I would definitely recommend this Hotel to anyone!

__label__very_positive	Very comfortable accommodations. I would not hesitate to stay there again. Although the location was relatively close to I-5 there was no noticeable traffic noise.
__label__positive	We just used the hotel for a place to relax and sleep.  The location is great because it is not too far from the major highways and there are plenty of places to eat.
__label__very_positive	Decent room, close to everything.
__label__neutral	Most of staff not very friendly except Sam which was very helpful and friendly. Food was sub par especially the pastries and the complementary breakfast personal were down right rude at times. The pillows were too small and had no firmness whatsoever I had to use two pillows to get a proper head height.

__label__positive	Great The house was perfect and fit our needs...we hung around the fireplace and played board games, had a few drinks while we played pool, and soaked in the hot tub after a long day on the slopes. We had Guitar Hero set up on the TV in the living room and Mario Cart set up downstairs in the game room. The house was perfect for getting out and hiking up the trails intersecting the property, sleigh-riding out back, and hanging out by the fire pit at night.
__label__very_positive	Convenient to restaurants and gas stations and interstate. Nice hotel
__label__positive	We can hear noises off and on created by the wind,We're on the 15th floor. Have to place towel to seal the door to prevent the wind escaping inside and creates annoyinunog loud noise. It works! For the price it's affordable, reasonable and saved lots of money. Free valet parking, and the attendants are helpful and courteous.

__label__very_positive	Come and see us Please! Response to, Not so Happy at Happy Tails I am a manager at Happy Tails and of course biased. But let me address Not so Happy at Happy Tails. Our daycare is very competitive and not the most expensive. Daycare begins the moment your dog is dropped off and runs until midnight. No other facility in St. Louis offers this flexibility for the price! We do kennel the medium to large dogs overnight, otherwise they would never go to sleep. Your pet needs 8-9 hours of rest just like you. This offers a respite from the long day of playing with the other dogs. We never force the dogs outside. They go outside naturally because they want to. They have a choice to play inside or outside unless we are cleaning inside which occurs every morning and evening. In the summer, we also provide the dogs kiddie pools to cool off! We have an open door policy here and everyone is invited to view the dogs in the yard. We also have a monitor in the lobby. If the dogs were miserable and scared, we would not allow the public to view this. Unlike a regular dog park, we make sure all the pets play fairly. This means that at times dogs are not allowed to run around in a crazed state and we monitor activity levels. We encourage our employees to play with and touch the dogs so there is plenty of affection spread around. We have turf that was specifically designed for dog play yards. It has 20 holes per square foot to allow proper drainage and is dusted with antimicrobial sand as needed. The turf is also sanitized daily. I often tell our employees to never allow feces to hit the ground. Happy Tails spends tens of thousands of dollars each year on specialized cleaning products and equipment for every surface of the facility and has employees whose entire shifts are dedicated to nothing but cleaning. Obviously the ex-employee was not doing her job properly. We take sanitation very seriously! So go ahead, come to Happy Tails, and we will gladly show you our facility including downstairs. I would have preferred the above employee would have addressed with management their issues but this never happened. We encourage employee involvement and are always striving to improve our facility.

__label__very_positive	Free coffee refills and budget rates make this motel tops with highway travelers. In ShortThe first Super 8 opened in Aberdeen, S.D., in 1974, charging 8.88 a night. Today, the national franchise, with its familiar red-and-yellow sign, still stands for dependable rooms at wallet-friendly prices. A staple for road-tripping families, truck drivers and tour groups, the motel offers complimentary morning coffee and continental breakfasts. Another perk for travelers: Super 8 travel cups may be refilled for free at any of the motel's locations.

Despite receiving confirmation emails from Expedia there was no record of my reservation at the hotel when I arrived.

The hotel was fully booked when I arrived but the staff at the front desk were luckily able to find a room for me.

__label__negative	The reception staff was friendly and willing to help us haul all our luggage up the stairs since there wasn't an elevator. The room and the hallway had a really funky smell that made us gag a bit. Not sure what that was! The room also seemed to be tilted a bit and lacked a bit on cleanliness. The AC didn't work and we had to sleep with the window open. Situated between the freeway and train tracks, made for a noisy night. Friendly staff was the only positive.

__label__very_positive	It was extremely nice for the rate! I would recomm
__label__neutral	Overall the hotel is nice. It's newly renovated and the rooms and spacious and comfortable. The buffet breakfast consisted of mostly what seemed like previously frozen food. It was free though so I guess you can't complain. The staff were pretty nice also. My main complaint is the noise level. We were located on the second floor. The people located in the room above me had children that slammed closed cabinets and doors and ran back and forth in their room, that was the first nights the rest of my 5 day stay consisted of new upstairs neighbors that stomped around as well and that is what I woke up to each morning.... Not quite what I was expecting on my vacation but I guess the hotel can't control the noise level of other people. I reccomend asking to stay on the top floor just to avoid any noise disturbances.
__label__very_positive	This was a mother/daughter get away. Room was clean, staff was great and helpful. We arrived early and couldn't check in but we were offered to use the pool if we wished. Great hotel for a nice relaxing quiet get away. The view is great over looking the bay. The fire pit at night is great. We will be going back.
__label__positive	Just spent one night but had a big room, comfortable couch and bed, nice view of the courtyard and a bit of the lake. They apparently allow pets (saw a lady walking her dogs in the courtyard) which is always nice. They do charge for parking (10 a day) which is a bit much I think.

__label__very_positive	Finding the Hotel was easy, it is in a great location, and checking in was easy. The hotel staff were very polite, helpful, and spoke perfect English (for English speaking guests). The room was very nice. Smaller than rooms in the US, but it was by no means cramped. Overall a great stay.
__label__very_negative	Hot rooms
__label__positive	The staff and the rooms were excellent and friendly. A moderate hum was heard in the upper floors of the hotel. I asked the front desk about it. I was given the option to move to another room. The manager and I walked around the hotel to find a room where the noise was acceptable. we found a wing (First floor) that is silent, and was moved to it.
__label__very_positive	Great room. Nice, clean and comfortable. Newer hotel in an area that has stores and STARBUCKS :)
__label__very_positive	We had a very relaxing stay at Brightwood Inn. The room was large and tranquil. We enjoyed the jacuzzi tub. Breakfast was great and they made gluten-free and dairy free accommodations for me. We enjoyed hiking at Matthiessen next door and rode our bikes on the IM canal towpath. We also enjoyed fine dining in nearby LaSalle.

__label__neutral	The was nothing wrong at this hotel The breakfast was in a nice open area with a huge window to watch the waves. The balcony was spacious enough for the both of us to enjoy. The bed was a nice king no sagging in the middle. The staff are great and always more than willing to help. The girls on the cleaning staff were very friendly too, nice to see in this day and age, but Its the view of the ocean that tops it all, so mesmerising and sparkly in the sun
__label__positive	It was worth . We enjoyed stay at super 8
__label__positive	We didn't eat at the hotel so I can't speak for the food or bar. The room was clean, adequate space, adequately appointed and stocked, everything worked, the staff was totally friendly and polite, helped whenever we asked. Couldn't ask for more. The decor is a bit dated, but just fine. Honestly it was a great deal. We stayed 3 nights over Valentine's Day weekend. Bed was comfy, plenty of pillows, nice duvet and an extra blanket in the closet. We were comfy and warm, in spite of record breaking cold outside. I had a delivery come for my husband and asked it be put in our room while we were out. I returned to it setting on the desk in the room. Well done Hampton Inn.
__label__very_positive	Great breakfast crew Leo, Alex, Hasa, Jose, great dinner options, Liz, Kris and chef Hany always on top of the kitchen. Farid has everything else covered for your stay. Can't wait to come back. Reservations with help from Annette, check in with Michelle and Nick always works for me.
__label__negative	The room was not cleaned properly. There was an empty pizza box and ants under the bed. I found this out because my sister was looking for something that was dropped and possibly rolled under the bed. Didn't find the item just the trash left behind by previous occupants!

Looks like safe neighborhood. Friendly receptionist.

AWFUL ROOM!! 1) There was a dead roach in the middle of the room. 2) The linen was tattered and had black smudge marks/stains. 3) THE SMELL OF THE ROOM WAS ATROCIOUS!! 4) Parking for the family (north tower) is despicable at best. 5) Front desk staff was nice and tolerable of my antsy, road trip toddler.

__label__positive	This property is a well maintained older hotel that we would definitely return to on business.

__label__positive	I am the disabled victim of a drunk driver. For 5 years now, I have been on very heavy doses of narcotic pain medication, and will be for life. It is very dangerous living alone, and I won't tolerate another human living with me. So, I have a specially trained dog trained as an alert dog to watch me and make my life safe to live. Last month, we (my dog, Dana and I) went to Ft Lauderdale, and we stayed at the Ocean breeze motel. We had a wonderful stay. The motel doesn't allow regular p...view moreets, which is one of the reasons we chose it. Less to possibly distract Dana. Beyond that, the rates were low enough for a lower income (the drunk was uninsured) disabled man and his K9 assistant. The owners treated us wonderfully, as they treat their property. What a great place to spend a week in paradise. After the grueling Chicago winter we have suffered (08-09), this motel felt like our home away from home, and we would definitely choose them if we ever would go to Ft Lauderdale again.

__label__positive	The room is of good size, hotel is in perfect location, just 3 min walk to main bus station, 4 min to Railway station, 5 min to city centre where most attractions are located. The breakfast is very good. What however needs to improve is the front desk staff service eg. Staff could wear a smile and be more helpful at times, the housekeeping replenishment service needs to be more consistent and professional. The service of staff at cafeteria is good though. Wifi in room is not so strong at times. Otherwise, the hotel is of good value.

__label__neutral	We were slightly disappointed in the hotel.  Although it was nice to have an indoor pool and all rooms had a balcony overlooking either the pool or overflow dining area, the humidity was too much, especially for the rooms on the higher floors.  You felt like you were waiting for the elevator outside instead of inside with the humidity.  In addition, we could not sit out on our balcony even if the humidity was not bad because our sliding glass door did not open in our room.  We did not complain to the front desk because we were only staying 2 nights in the hotel but we did let the maid know.

__label__very_negative	Sadly, this hotel has gone down hill as the Hilton brand continues to cut corners across its lesser brand lines.

__label__very_positive	I Normale work at home, but due to an event I wanted to attend in Grams Prairie, I had to work from my hotel room which I was nervous about. It worked out perfectly! It was quiet, and walked to nearby fast food places for a quick break. Staff was friendly, courteous. Next time I'll ask for a room on the top floor. As my window was not 5 feet from the parking lot. But again, it was not bothersome. Perfect for my needs!

__label__very_positive	Their 2 bed suite is really a 1 bedroom with a studio. The walls only went half way and it wasn't really separated.
__label__neutral	An unpretentious older motel, good value for the price. Adequate room was noisy - will ask to be upstairs if I stay here again - with somewhat scary carpet/odd odor. Minuses would be noise - not only the neighbors but trains although the tracks are close to most Eugene motels so hard to avoid. Hot tub was not really hot. Staff on the other hand was quite pleasant and helpful, made excellent restaurant recommendation, provided extra towels for the (warm) hot tub. Continental breakfast while not fancy was better than expected, nice muffins/bagels and fresh fruit. Very convenient location for downtown restaurants and little theatre.
__label__positive	Comfortable
__label__very_positive	Great Visit To Sarasota
__label__positive	Great Price Weird Smell
__label__neutral	The breakfast was very poor. The eggs were still mostly frozen. White bread only.
__label__positive	Typical road motel that hasn't been updated in awhile but the rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. If you're looking for luxury, elegance, and price-gouged frou frou accommodations, go someplace else. If you're smart, and would rather spend your hard-earned money on fine wine and dining as well as on pampering yourself (Calistoga mud baths!), this is a safe clean place to lay down your head. Just a short 3 minute drive to downtown Napa, and easy access to the main highway leading to all the wineries. Surprisingly good coffee. The free breakfast is enough to get you on the road but the breakfast itself is fairly mediocre.
__label__very_negative	"HORRIBLE!!! DO NOT STAY HERE!! The front desk staff and hotel management is disorganized and unprofessional. We had our wedding ceremony here and when family called to check in, the front desk had no idea what they were talking about. In the end, I had to book some of the rooms myself for family, and ""no rooms were booked under the wedding party name"" as the front fesk informed me. They double booked the bride and grooms rooms. They quoted us one rate and changed it when we checked out. When we talked to the management about it, he accused us of making up rates and offered us an insulting $10 off our rooms after we (bride and groom) had spent over $1400 there in two days, not counting the 10+ rooms booked for at least two nights each by friends and family.On a health and cleanliness note, we went to use the jacuzzi tub and brown, slimy stuff came out of the jets when we turned them on, a clear sign of an inproperly cleaned tub.BAD GUEST SERVICE!!!!"

__label__neutral	I've stayed here twice in the last week. The 3rd floor stay last week was nicer than the 1st floor. Even though the room was prepaid, this time they insisted on taking a credit card for any damage I may cause. They did not do this last week. I checked the room closely for fear that I may get charged. The door would not close unless I pushed it shut (140). The remote control for the TV was broken. On the 3rd try we found a remote that sort of worked. It skipped 2 channels at a time but at least worked. The sink had a long crack and the tub had a hole. There was an old wash cloth left on the shower rod. The bed was comfortable. I like that they give you 4 pillows of different levels of softness. Overall, just an OK stay this time.

__label__positive	Room was nice and clean and bed was very comfortable. On the downside, the volume didn't work on TV and it was too late when we got back to the room to call for assistance. The bathroom door would hang up on commode when opening or closing and you had to really shove it to clear the commode. We don't expect a great breakfast but it did not meet our expectations.

__label__very_positive	Stayed for business, rooms were great as was the amenities
__label__negative	The hotel.com reservation said it was a standard room with a kitchen and it didn't have the kitchenette or the continental breakfast even though the hotel sign still said free continental breakfast.

I would not recommend it to anyone unless u just need a place to lock yourself in and sleep.

__label__very_positive	If you are staying in Old Town and are not afraid to spend a little money then this is the hotel for you. The Monaco is located almost smack dab in the middle of Old Town.

__label__neutral	This hotel is average in all categories. The rooms aren't immaculate, but they are clean enough. Each room has a balcony that offers privacy from your neighbors, which is a nice extra. I found the internet speeds to be adequate enough to enjoy my Netflix and browsing. Breakfast wasn't too shabby; they served waffles, toast, milk, concentrated juice, coffee, oatmeal, and oddly enough, Ho-Hos.The surrounding area does offer many eating and shopping options.I would use this hotel again if I am able to get a similar low price.
__label__very_positive	Very clean, very nice and updated, good price for sleeping
__label__positive	Pizza is awesome. Really awesome.
__label__very_positive	End of journey
__label__positive	For the area, this is a good hotel. It could use some updating in the sleeping rooms but it is nice to count on a microwave and refrigerator. My last experience staying with them was not so pleasant because I waited an hour for the hotel shuttle to pick me up from the metro stop. The night shift clerk did not think to call the driver's cell phone when it was obvious that radio was wasn't working - I called four times to say I was still waiting. They could probably do a little more training for the night staff.
__label__very_positive	Where do I even begin with all the wonderful things to say about this place. We had our wedding here and planned the entire thing from New York - now this would not have happened if it wasn't for Julie Stanfield. She is amazing and that is a true understatement! She took care of every little detail and allowed me to not stress one bit the day of the wedding. The venue is BEAUTIFUL. All of the out-of-state guests loved it, saying it was the most peaceful place with the nicest staff they have ever met. Everything from the rooms to the staff to the food was impeccable. As far as the wedding and reception - it was literally perfect (we even extended an hour). Nothing, nothing at all, went wrong that I am aware of. And if something did, Julie is so good she would have taken care of it without my knowing. She took care of all the little details that a bride forgets about, like putting purses and cell phones in a safe spot, holding my flowers on cue when needed, taking gifts back to our room, along with setting up rose petals and champagne on our bed without us knowing! She is on the ball 24/7 with planning and was always reachable, even on her days off. We HIGHLY recommend using Lakeway for your wedding, if not just a vacation! The staff is nothing short of amazing :)

__label__very_positive	We originally planned on booking the Riu for my bachelorette party but they were fully booked so we settled on this hotel. Check-in was great, Sergio upgraded the two double bed suites we had booked to a presidential suite. The suite had two bedrooms, two full bathrooms, a kitchen, dining, and living area. Best of all it came with a jacuzzi with an oceanview patio. It was perfect for me and my girls! The food was really good compared to what I've had at the Riu. The staff was super friendly and helpful. My only complaint is that the hotel is so big that you have to take a golf cart everywhere, whether it's to go eat or swimming at the pool.
__label__positive	it was comfortable and having the starbucks there added to my happiness lol. the rooms need updating but it served it's purpose but, the family suites all face the back of the hotel. :( everything was good . would stay again.

__label__very_negative	Disappointed & will choose another hotel next stay
__label__neutral	I had an interesting stay here and it only lasted 24 hours originally I was planning to stay for four nights. First, let me say if you want a clean, modern room and a modern and nice hotel with nice staff this place is fine. It certainly gets the job done. The reason I checked out was I had called before as I am 6-5 to make sure I would have a rainfall shower and they confirmed it. All the pictures showed a rainfall shower in the bathroom. Mine of course did not have that. Then I was overlooking (I was on the second floor) right out my window the hotel dumpsters. Finally, my toilet seat was broken. I personally was on vacation and I wanted everything to be perfect. On the plus size the croissants were excellent, and the hotel has a nice look and feel and so did my room. So as you can see I was kind of split on the experience. If you are looking to save money on the bigger expensive hotels and want something easy and modern this is nice and the design is pretty cool. Hope that helps.

__label__negative	We arrived late and were tired. When the door to the non-smoking room was opened the cigarette smoke smell hit us like the smell of cat pee! The frig was hard to open and not turned on, the phone by the bed was plugged in but NOT WORKING. The bed was sloppily made. The only thing that saved that room was the large two-person tub with jets - it was clean and there was plenty of hot water! The bed was a comfortable bed, but all the linens and towels smelled of smoke as well. This is one of those hotels that is decades old, is going through low budget renovation, and is in the middle (I think) of the process so it looked unpleasantly incomplete - especially for the price paid!

__label__very_negative	It was a horrible stay because the room was outdated and old everything was dirty the toilet and the sink had plumbing problems and they ran all night long and bubbled like they were backing off and going to overflow the hallways with smelly and dark and grungy I will never stay here again

__label__very_positive	Simple clean room Great Staff!
__label__neutral	It's a fairly basic place to stay. My family stayed for a week, choosing this hotel because of price and the good reviews. The price was one of the lowest in the entire metro area. But, price does not equal value. The outdoor pool and shuttle service are shared with the hotel next door, which isn't made clear in the listing. More than once, the shuttle stopped and waited for people to get on next door and proceeded to either drive off immediately without stopping or was too full to carry the passengers waiting here. When you're in DC, expect to wait -- that's just how things work here. (TIP for the hotel: Arlington Cemetery's gravesite shuttle has a direct phone, instead of a two-way radio.) Our housekeeper was good, but there was a roach in our room. Nice bedding and towels. The bed was uncomfortable, but there were signs posted that said that the hotel was beginning a remodel. The hot breakfast was meh, and the breakfast area was very small for the size of the hotel. Most of the staff at this hotel speaks a language other than English as a first language -- can be problematic if you are calling for the shuttle and can't understand what they are saying. This hotel is definitely not in the easy-off, easy-on category. The hotel is located in an extra-confusing maze of roads. Getting to the hotel from the interstate isn't too bad, but getting back to the interstate and finding restaurants nearby is rather difficult. We'll find somewhere else next time.

__label__negative	We stayed last minute while passing through to New Mexico. I asked for a quiet room and explained to the guy I am a chronic complainer of night noise. He chose to put us in a room with a shared door, under a bunch of high schoolers who jumped on the bed until midnight (because they woke me up) and loud lobby noise (which went away around 10:30). I heard every faucet being turned on, every thing the neighbors said and every door close and open. I think the walls between the rooms were an illusion because they certainly didn't block anything except who was in the room next door. It was of course the last room and we were so incredibly road weary. We to stuck with it. And the room smelled like someone had just gone in there and let one rip. Must have seeped through the imaginary walls.

__label__very_negative	The room condition was atrocious. Peeling wallpaper and paint, stains on the bedding, carpet, and bathroom. The beds themselves, were like prison mattresses. A fire alarm started blaring early in the morning, and when it clearly wasn't getting turned off, we decided to get up and go to breakfast. There was no one at the counter. The fire department was outside, as were other guests. When we checked out later and asked about it, the guy seemed totally dismissive about the inconvenience. I would not book this hotel again.

__label__very_positive	A very long road trip meant spending nights in a lot of various motels. Staying at a Comfort Inn, right after spending four days in a nightmare of a motel, was heaven. The room was spacious, clean and very, oh so very, comfortable. I just wish I could give it more than just a 5 for a rating.
__label__neutral	stay in Boone
__label__very_positive	The hotel looks renovated cleanly. Compared to the prior ownership, the current ownership made a significant improvement in the facility and service. The staff was very courteous and the breakfast was wonderful. So, I decided to go back to this hotel during my next trip to Charlotte.

__label__positive	Good Motel
__label__positive	very nice hotel. this is what i usually expect from a country inn suites. the water slide in the pool area was a plus, especially for the kids. comfortable room and breakfast was very good. cookies in the front desk was very nice as well. only negative would have to be the A/C, which was soooo noisy. there were times when it was even difficult to hear the TV because of the noise. couldn't higher the volume so as to be courteous to the other guests who checked in. the noise of the A/C was enough, couldn't add the TV noise also to disturb the peace.
__label__very_positive	never again
__label__negative	So we got a 200 suite here. We booked this hotel because a previous review said you could smoke on the balcony. In fact this did not turn out to be true, the hotel has a very strict policy and threatens a huge fine for smoking. We parked in the car park when we arrived and were informed it would be 34 to leave our car there! Even with how much we had spent on the suite!! Can you imagine!! As for the suite, it was big and fancy, but not 200 fancy. I've stayed in many better hotels for a quarter of that price. And they included parking, breakfast and were considerably better located. Don't waste your time with these overpriced fools.
__label__very_positive	Very nice hotel
__label__positive	The hotel is very nice and the staff is very affordable. Good value of the money. Few blocks from the subway and not far from downtown. They have parking space. The rooms are clean and comfortable, the breakfast is good.
__label__neutral	Double King fit our family great. Room smelled a little funny like burnt rubber, breakfast left something to be desired, but they had waffles and that was a plus! But overall for the value we are super pleased.
__label__positive	breakfast was great. Quiet room and very clean. Was a liitle upset about no indoor swimming pool and or spa and the fact that you had to wait till exactly three before check-in. other than that it was a great hotel. I would probably stay there again

__label__neutral	The staff were all very pleasant and helpful, but the poor mattress really messed my sleep. The housekeeping accidentally put my beach towel in their laundry and it didn't come back, neither did the front desk offer to reimburse me or get me another towel. The shower never got any hotter than tepid.
__label__positive	UW got me this hotel during my visit and it was amazing. If possible, ask for a room with a view of the Space Needle. Rooms are big, nicely styled and comfortable. Wifi wasn't very reliable, it kept disconnecting. Try the cafeteria downstairs and the amazing apple donuts.

__label__very_negative	Hotel is not the nice of condition, breakfast was horrible, wifi is horrible. The air was not working properly in our room, very hot. We asked for extra towels, they would only give us 2 more. There were ant and bug traps behind the TV stand and bed stands. My husband thinks there were bed bugs as he was bitten up from the bed. Just not a very nice hotel especially for being under the name Hilton.
__label__very_negative	Terrible experience
__label__very_negative	The best thing I can say about this joint is that at least I didn't have to sleep in a ditch, but that's not saying too much. r r The bed was fairly comfortable, but this place is badly in need of an update: stained carpet, stained and whip-stitched together thermal blanket, cigarette-burned bedspread, moldy refrigerator, rusted microwave, huge spiders in the bathroom.

__label__very_negative	Terrible the hall ways in tower three were filthy as well as the elevators. The room had stains on the carpet and bathtub totally out of date. Climate control in the room wasn't very good because of location of drapes. I ended up leaving a day early. The room was prepaid so I ate it I expected so much more from Harrahs.
__label__negative	Very overpriced for what you get, but there aren't many hotels in this area to choose from and they ALL seem to overcharge. Don't count on filling up at the free breakfast. There is almost nothing there and barely any seating. Our room was pretty dirty. Very stained chair which we chose not to sit in. Housekeeping had left a dirty towel from the previous occupant hanging in the bathroom. Not too noisy considering they were fully booked, and the beds were relatively comfortable. Also had a large refrigerator, which we weren't expecting. Good location and free parking, but that's about it.

__label__neutral	The staff was friendly and helpful, the room needed alot of improvement. Broken bathroom door and dirty carpet.
__label__very_negative	When we checked in no one was at the front desk then after hitting the bell a young teenager came to the front and was a little clueless on how to check us in so he called someone else and the man who apparently was his father, ungroomed, who looked liked he was watching television in the back came to check us in. He passed me a paper to fill out with my contact information so I could have a receipt. As he proceeded to check me in the price hotel.com promised was a dollar less than what he was charging me which means that hotel.com price was not a guarantee so I was charged more. Although I had my email showing the price, the man continued to argue with me about the additional dollar and would not budge. It took all of 15 minutes to check into the hotel and the room was seedy. Cigarette burn on the toilet... Outdated and pretty much with the price we paid. I was not very happy and am so glad we only stayed 1 day. Never again!

__label__positive	Close to restaurants, stores and freeways. Good pricing and dog-friendly. Good breakfast with not-bad-for-a-hotel breakfast eggs and sausage, among the usual waffles toast, bagels, fruit, cereal, etc. Our 2 queens room and its tiny bathroom were pretty tight, and the A/C compressor was loud. Grassy lot next door was convenient for exercising my dog. Good value overall.
__label__positive	Not a bad place. We had four people in one room. One double bed and two singles, the single were to small and uncomfortable. The room had plenty of room for another double bed. The breakfast did not accommodate gluten free. I have yogurt for breakfast. The restaurant waiter was trying to up sell . He was bringing out food we didn't order all night and wanted us to pay for it.

__label__positive	Front desk wonderful. rooms fine. free breakfast ok but eggs pretty bleak, spongy, watery etc. the layout of the breakfast line could be much more user friendly as well as easier to restock if the toast/pastry part was not heading into corner of walls. Also, maybe a sign asking patrons to help themselves to the pancake machine but to please bring all butters, syrups, jellies etc to be used on pancakes back to table to avoid causing a logjam so others could get to the machine. May be minor point, but would improve the whole breakfast experience commensurate with the hotel quality. Thanks, Glenn Secola

__label__negative	We found the Hotel to be an old antiquated Howard Johnson. It backs up to highway 87 and the trucks can be heard through the night in the rooms facing the highway which we were in. The doors need to be replaced through out the hotel, wiring runs haphazardly over the roofs, and the bathtub had cracks from old age. No refrigerators in the rooms which we missed. The hotel is being repainted and seems to be a work in motion. Morning breakfast was limited, no yogurt.
__label__very_positive	Enjoyable Stay!
__label__very_positive	The hotel seemed new! Right off the interstate and a lot of restraunts are within a mile.
__label__very_negative	No continental breakfast.  Not even a cold one.  Really?  For what I paid?  Really?And half of the TV channels were fuzzy.  Really?  For what I paid?  Really?I visit Warren annually, but I'll be at the Hampton Inn from now on...
__label__very_negative	Rude and angry staff could not figure out how to use the computer.  He kept looking through stacks of papers and yelling at customers because we did not have printouts from Expedia to prove we had a reservation.  I called help desk and then the clerk yelled at him for 5 minutes.  Then Expedia explained that they could not help me get a new hotel room until the clerk agreed to refund Expedia.  So no room and no money - but Expedia did offer my a $50 credit.  So I was stranded in San Antonio at 1 in the morning with a credit - soooooo helpful.  I asked to talk to a supervisor - was told that there was a 45 minute wait.  Hummm I guess the long wait is because none of your customers are happy.
__label__positive	Arrived just after 5:00, so didn't see any staff, but the key was waiting for us with nice instructions. (only a 2 hour check-in window, apparently) We had to leave early the next morning, so again no staff interaction. Had to check out later by phone. I was disappointed that the bathroom was not en suite, but across the hall (yet ours exclusively). Perhaps I didn't notice this when I booked the room, but it should have been made clear at the time of the booking. At this price point, I expect my own bathroom, attached to the room. Mattress was very hard, but I encounter that at most hotels. But a pleasant room and you can't beat the location! We walked to a restaurant for dinner, then a nice stroll by the beach.
__label__negative	It will do for the night, over paid.

__label__neutral	The hotel is in a nice setting, right next door to the Ryan mansion and just a 3 minute drive to historic Galena shops and restaurants. Free breakfast was much better than expected, and the woman working the waffle iron went out of her way to make sure everyone was taken care of. Beds were very comfortable. Only complaint- the bathroom was beaten up and tub stained. And the kid's pool looked dirty and disgusting. Never saw any little ones in there, thank goodness.

There were people living in the hotel and digging through the trash in the morning. There was a smell of mildew in the room. People were smoking everywhere so i couldn't keep the window open for fresh air. This place is not safe for children or the elderly. They have to have armed security guards patrol regularly and they tell you so on a sticker in the window of the office. I would avoid this place at all costs.

__label__very_positive	We stayed for 3 nights. The room was clean--no problems at all. Because this is an extended stay hotel, there's no cleaning service the first week, but that didn't bother us-we weren't terribly messy. Plus, the hotel staff was so nice. The light breakfast was packaged foods like oats bars, grits muffins plus some fresh fruit. Very good for a trip to the park. Universal is right across the street, but it does take some time to get to the actual park entrance. It's a 2mi walk. Getting there was no problem, it was going home that was the killer. But, it was a nice room to come back to. The area of town was good well-lit. We walked around at night and never felt unsafe.

__label__very_positive	I was very pleased with my visit. I came to stay the night with my 3 kids. The room was very spacious. I think this room was the most spacious I had ever been in! We swam multiple times. The water could have been a little warmer but we all had a blast!

__label__positive	I am a very picky hotel guest--somewhat of a hotel snob. The Hampton Inn is an affordable, clean hotel with a great location.

__label__positive	Small room, big sleep.
__label__very_negative	They use something like a plug in or cleaner in the rug which is over powering. I could not breathe. I felt like I was being suffocated by an air freshener. Obviously this is used to cover the stinch of being a smoker's hotel. The heat kept making a dripping noise. I think I slept about an hour the entire night.
__label__very_positive	Room was clean, staff were entirely accommodating and helpful. Breakfast was very good except for the readi-eggs that most hotels serve for breakfast. Walls were thin, but most are. Staff (from front desk to housekeeping) were great! Some pointers: Rooms: clean, comfy, don't expect a Hilton because you paid for a Best Western Pool: smallish but clean with enough pool chairs Breakfast: 6-9:30, pancakes, waffles, eggs, sausage, coffee, tea, muffins, fruit, juice, oatmeal, cereal and more... wow! Location: In downtown, but in the a lower-income neighborhood Staff: totally helpful. hair dryer, directions, shuttle, free parking, wine opener, etc.
__label__positive	Comfortable, Hassle-Free Stay
__label__neutral	We were very pleased with our stay at Days Inn. We travel to and from Florida twice per year and we always stay here. Would recommend it to anyone who wants a good place to stay. The breakfast could be expanded a little. We have stayed in other Days Inns that have a much better breakfast choice.
__label__neutral	Good play to stay.
__label__very_positive	Immaculate accommodations with an incredible view from my balcony, overlooking the river and the colorful rock formations just beyond!

__label__neutral	Nice enough
__label__very_negative	While the concierge was nice and accommodating, the room was disgusting. It was dirty with spots and stains on the carpet and walls. My first act was to kill an unidentifiable insect on the cooling unit. And my non-smoking room was laden with the odor of cigarette smoke.
__label__positive	The staff was pleasant and helpful and the location was very convenient. Our rooms were the largest in the hotel and very quiet. After four nights in the smallest and noisiest and most expensive hotel room I have ever had in London, this hotel was a pleasant surprise. The breakfast was fantastic and the lady that took care of the buffet was very nice. We enjoyed our stay at the Hotel An Der Philharmonie very much.
__label__positive	Nice little place!
__label__neutral	Not bad for the price.
__label__neutral	Bien pour une nuit
__label__positive	We stayed in a premium suite and while the building is not very attractive (6-floor concrete building), the suite itself was great, brand-new and beautiful with a large tub and a balcony. The resort is really nice, although the beach is far from spectacular, but the pools and common area are pristine. The resort has several restaurants that obviously try to be fancy (no buffet, it's all table service), as well as 24-hr room service, but while service was really good we found the food somewhat hit-or-miss, and (perhaps not surprisingly, but a bit disappointing) lacking any authenticity. Same thing can be said of drinks, pina colada was great but margaritas were incredibly sweet, and at breakfast the orange juice decidedly tasted chemical, not quite fresh. We actually went outside the resort specially to be able to try some real Mexican food! If you don't have a car there is not much around, although there are great snorkeling places within 15 min drive (valet parking is free, which is very convenient). Overall we had a really good time, but I don't think we will be back (first time at an all-inclusive resort, so I can't compare to the competition though)

__label__negative	A web sight highly rated this hotel. For this reason and with a good rate, I booked the hotel.As is our practice, we bring wipes to clean the phone, door knobs, TV remote and bathroom etc. We found all of the above dirty. The bath grab handle was all mold. We covered the handle when the tub was used. I did not complain to the hotel because the were begining a remodel of the public bath which led me to believe their answer would be remodeling.

__label__very_negative	When I went into the room I just cried. The beds were dirty had hair, dirt and stains all over. The bathroom was unacceptable hair and dirt in toilet and the shower wasnt clean. The carpet had food, dirt, hair and trash on it. The couch and chair was ripped up and horribly stained. The door looked like it was kicked in. The heater/ac unit wouldn't push heat because it was clogged with food, gunk and kids little toys. The only cleanish area was in the closet. This was the worst hotel I've ever been in. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL!!

__label__neutral	You get what you pay for
__label__very_positive	Great stay
__label__negative	I'm not hard to please, but the second I walked into the hotel I had to wait to be greeted. When I was finally greeted I began the check-in process with the manager I presume and then I was passed off to another employee when another customer walked in. I shrugged it off as I thought maybe they were just busy (there were only 3 people). The next day I went to pick up a drink and a snack from the concierge and again I stood there at the counter without even a hello while the employee looked at the computer and then paperwork. When I was finally greeted, I started my transaction with the employee and again was passed off to another employee, presumably another manager. What should have taken 1 minute took 5 and I was really starting to feel like my business was not appreciated here. The room was decent, but it had an old smell similar to mildew in the bathroom that really bothered me. I almost checked out of the hotel the first night to go across the street to another. I didn't have a very pleasant experience here and I would not recommend it to anyone. You can find a nicer hotel for a similar price.

__label__neutral	It started poorly. The shuttle went right by us at the airport. The hotel was quick to suggest we take a taxi , which they reimbursed us for.  We were early but they graciously showed us to our room.the room was rather small and a little scruffy. They give us another room it was somewhat better but the bed was almost certainly not a queen and the pillows were very thick and hard. the staff was good and the location is great

__label__positive	This was our 8th hotel in 9 days. It was by far the nicest hotel we stayed at for half the cost of the others. Each of the rooms have animal names, which makes it nice for families with young kids. The breakfast was standard breakfast fair - eggs, sausage, biscuits, gravy, potatoes, cereal, etc. It was decent, but nothing spectacular. The beds are double size, so a little small, but the room was a good size, so you weren't tripping over each other. Our only complaint was the air conditioners did not seem able to keep the room cool - in either room we were in. We had it set at 70, then moved it down to 66, but still sweat throughout the night. It was a muggy feeling. But other than that, this hotel was great.
__label__positive	It was OK . they paid for the ice I purached.
__label__positive	Nice spot close to everything
__label__negative	Wallpaper peeling from wall, puke stains on furniture. People drinking and loud partying just outside my room until midnight at the pool. Then at 3am sounded like a tag team wrestling match in room just above me. Breakfast could gag a Billy goat, and the neighborhood was sketchy. Otherwise it was OK.
__label__very_positive	The hotel managers were helpful and friendly and the room was clean and fully set up.

__label__positive	For the price it was a great stay. The beds were comfortable, the rooms were very quiet and clean and the staff was nice. The breakfast buffet in the restaurant was ok, better than a continental breakfast. Was disappointed at how far we had to walk to get to our room, and there were no elevators - had to use the stairs. The pool was clean and the kids had fun there. The arcade was great too. Would definitely stay here again when in the area.
__label__very_positive	Hotel carino, vicino alla metro e al centro di torremolinos. Ottima base per escursioni e la spiaggia si raggiunge sia con la navetta gratuita che con una bella passeggiata per le vie centrali. Ottimo buffet sia a colazione che a cena!

__label__very_positive	We were both so impressed with Barbara and her greeting as we pulled in. Honestly, the little things that these guys do mean so much and go a long way with guests. Beautiful grounds, great room, felt like we were in a bedroom in our own home. I would come back here and tell anyone coming to Santa Barbara to stay here. Loved it. Just wish we could have stayed longer.
__label__positive	horrible customer service!
__label__very_negative	I was in a nonsmoking room, and the room itself was free of odor. The hallway had a distinctly off odor, clearly not smoke free. The room and bathroom seemed basically clean. However, the curtain was visibly stained. The cleaning crew did not clean the toilet the first day (it clogged, and still was when I returned in the evening). The capstone I got to watch a large, many legged bug 1.5 long scurry across the bathroom floor and out of sight. I then discovered another similar one behind the shower curtain on the floor dead next to the tub.

The kitchenette was full service with a microwave, refrigerator, two-burner stove, sink, dishes. The room was very clean and the view from both the patio and the bedroom was fantastic. There were two televisions, one in the living room and one in the bedroom. I really enjoyed my break. Thank you to everyone.
__label__positive	My last stay at this facility was about 10 years ago. It is better now than I remember it nearly new. Room 112 was very clean, odor free, and did not require an anti-histamine. We looked at an alternative room (maybe it was 120) to which a masking scent had been used in an attempt to cover up smoke contamination. Breakfast was adequate.

__label__positive	although from the outside this property may look a little dated, the rooms are actually big and comfortable. The beds are comfortable, everything works fine and the breakfast offers eggs and sausage, along with yogurt, breads and waffles. There were lots of places around the property to eat and had access to most freeways.
__label__positive	Another fine trip.
__label__positive	The hotel itself and the room were clean, well kept and up to date. Breakfast was a typical buffet style. We enjoyed the waffles shaped like the state of Texas. The staff we encountered were all cordial and professional. My only complaints we be the air conditioning unit being right next to the bed, so it got rather cold. Also the bed was uncomfortable. That may be because I'm used to my mattress at home. I would definitely stay in this hotel again.

__label__neutral	Memphis Trip Positives and Negatives
__label__very_negative	Awful, awful, awful!!! On our trip from FL to VT we had stayed at a Hampton the previous night and it was just exceptional, so we sought out another Hampton Inn along our trip. We were traveling with our 2 non-shedding very well behaved medium sized dogs and were told at check in that there would be a 75 pet fee per dog! There was no indication of this online at all. The check in clerk stated that they were having problems with dogs so just changed their policy to charge a fee, and she was nice enough to only charge us for one pet - 75.00. Are you kidding We were then put in one of the pet rooms which shared a wall with the elevator and that's exactly what we heard the entire night, the elevator going up and down. We asked to be moved but was told there are only so many pet friendly rooms and there were no other rooms available. Pet friendly You must mean pet tolerant since in no way was this hotel pet friendly. On top of that I could not get the room to cool off and the air conditioner made a horrible noise the entire night. What a change from the Hampton Inn in Columbia, SC that we stayed the night before, a real gem! I would never stay at this hotel again.
__label__very_negative	I will stay here again....
__label__positive	good hotel
__label__very_positive	Hotel and location were amazing. The hotel grounds are extremely large so please be aware that there is a lot of uphill walking or waiting for the shuttle carts the wait is not long since there are numerous carts throughout the facility. Can't wait to go back! You also get use of the two sister hotels- Blanco and Rose- and the Sunset provides a free shuttle service to these hotels downtown.

__label__negative	not much but OK
__label__neutral	Wifi was horrible I kept getting kicked off and losing my work. Had to go to Starbucks to do work on Internet.
__label__very_negative	We checked into our room, looked at the condition it was in, and left. We did not stay. Check in was awkward, as the front desk person was insulting and possibly high. When he looked at my ID he said This is you You look good. You know, in your picture only. Direct quote. The room was gross. The walls were grimy, the mirror on the door broken, the carpet was filthy, and there were holes in the bed linens. We left almost immediately. I was so put off by the rude front desk, I didn't even try to get my money back. We just fled.
__label__neutral	it was good, but nothing extraordinary
__label__neutral	Check in was very quick and easy. We just stayed for one night, so it was all about location. The hotel could use some updating. There were visible drywall repairs throughout the facility. We also had a tough time programming the television to work but finally got it working. Breakfast provided many offerings and the dining room was packed. We went down at 9am, thinking we would miss the early rush and found that we were in the midst of the rush and could not find a place to sit. The employees were very friendly - both at check in and check out. I am not a fan of the chlorine smell with indoor pools but there were many families taking advantage and it was in use every time we passed by.

__label__negative	Have stayed in this motel every couple of years and it has gone done in the following respects, though the room accommodation remained good: 1)Housekeeping personnel and desk-clerk and manager, always kept someone smoking within five-feet of the entrance/ext. Annoying. 2)In the past the Continental Breakfast was nicely presented. Not this time. Had to ask for one thing and thing another, calling the desk-clerk to leave the lounge chair more than once, rather than his surveying the kitchen to see what else may be lacking. 3)At the top of the stairs cigarette smoke-smells were prevalent, though I had a non-smoking room. Though not overpowering, my room had the scent of the same. I will not stay there again on my next trip in two years.

Guess I need to use the bathroom ok sir wait here we are trollying you up to the port o potties !! Completely waist of a trip and when called harrahs only offered me the resort fee refund! Harrahs and hotels.com need to do something about this to complete customer satisfaction
__label__very_positive	I have stayed at the IP three times in the past few years ... and EVERY time has been AMAZING! At check in, the employees smile and seem happy to be there, making sure to explain any additional charges that may apply during the stay. On my most recent visit, they printed a new player's card at the check-in counter for me, and replaced my husband's card too. The view from the room was of the ocean ... while yes, it is a ways away, there isn't much in Biloxi, and from our floor (20th) we were able to see it clearly. We always eat at the HighTide restaurant at least once every visit and this time was AMAZING. Since our last visit, I was placed on a restrictive diet and the HighTide was very accomodating to my insane requests. I had the fish of the day (Tilapia backened) and it was melt in your mouth fabulous. My husband said that his All American Breakfast hit the spot for him too. The casino isn't always friendly to us, but our luck is better here than at any other casino in either Vegas or Biloxi. We typically have one bad day followed by one REALLY good one. ... and we go home breaking even. And hey, we had the chance at the jackpot. :) The servers could use a wardrobe update ... I am not a fan of the exposed bra behind a corset top ... but asside from the atrocious attire, they are SUPER friendly and attentive. Of course, just like anywhere else, generous tipping will keep them coming around more often .... especially when you're drinking non-alcoholic beverages. :) Check out was easy and stress free as well ... and Juana, our room attendant, did a wonderful job on our last visit. I left her a tip when we left because she was awesome enough to leave us some extra coffee and creamer upon request. I will never stay anywhere else.

__label__very_positive	If you have transportation, this is the spot to stay in Krefeld, Germany. The hotel is very nice and clean, with friendly staff. They had construction going on during my stay and the Expedia info did not mention this, so this was unexpected. I did not use he room during the day, so this was not a problem for me, but for someone on vacation, this could be a disaster........there was loud hammer drills, etc. The food is very good, as was everything.........only the construction issue not being noted as a special condition was a negative.
__label__negative	"Two of the three hotel staff I interacted with were not professional in their appearance; neither did they interact with me in a way that affirmed that I was a human being or a welcome customer. (One staff member was good though.) From what I could see, the room-cleaning staff does the best they can with what they have. The rate charged for the room was attractive but the savings comes at a different cost. This hotel really ""needs that special something."""

__label__very_negative	I realize it is a cheap hotel (paid about 50 for our stay) but even at that, I expected the room to at least be clean. The hall way was unfinished (we were on the third floor) and just looked run down. The bathroom, was filthy looking upon our entry - so much so my 11 year old did not want to even shower in it the next morning. The beds and sheets, were uncomfortable. About a week after staying here - my girls came home from school with full fledged lice - which we traced back to our stay here. So gross, will never stay again.

I totally agree with trueanimal lover... they do show you around and don't take you to the downstairs. I actually saw the trainer put the dogs in a sitting position and went to talk to the manager about their personal life. How Nice! I bet my dog would learn a lot there. The grooming... do they listen I had a horrible experience the very first time I took my dog to get groomed there- but decided to give it a second chance- never again! Pros: Location, Prices Cons: What you pay for is what you get, unprofessional rude teenagers, I can go on and on and on. You know it's bad, when you'd rather go to Petsmart or Petco.

__label__positive	Thank you for the great service How can you go wrong when you can spend your vacation time relaxing in the luxury of a beautiful, sparklingly clean 4 bedroom, 4 bathroom fully appointed home complete with its own private pool and spa, 2 master suites with king-size beds, game room, covered lanai, massive main TV and a total of 5 televisions and 5 DVD players Answer: you cant. And its pretty amazing that if you added up the cost of a single room at a Disney property that sleeps 4, and the cost of every meal, snack and beverage, it is LESS EXPENSIVE! We will NEVER stay in a hotel again it would be insane!
__label__very_positive	Clean but dated.
__label__positive	The food at breakfast was good but we had to wait 40 minutes to get it because there was only one cook working.
__label__positive	Stayed on 11/3/15 and again on 11/11/15. Late arrival at airport on return trip (11:30 PM) was no problem. Hotel shuttle picked us up quickly. Staff is great! Room is clean, comfortable and quiet.This is the second time we have stayed there when traveling out of the country and will stay there again.

__label__neutral	Nice Property - get upgraded rooms
__label__positive	quick overnight stay.. staff was friendly and helpful. doors were kinda tough to work and one clerk had to come help us open it. note of interest.. this is NOT beach side.. the beach is about 10 minutes away. breakfast is a coupon to mcdonalds.. not bad.. different!
__label__neutral	The service was good. Continental breakfast was very simple like a biscuit, apple,only chocolate donut. I understand continental but that was extremely simple. My sink had a crack and was missing some of the fixture towards the bottom. Room clean, but small.
__label__very_negative	"First thing I saw when I walked into my room was that the TV was plugged into an outlet on the other side of the room with an extension cord draped across the middle of the floor. Next, it seems as though the ""maintenance person"" had been trying to snake a clog from the toilet because they left the snake IN the toilet along with a brown sludge.I went and asked for another room. The hotel keys were reprogrammed incorrectly, so I went back AGAIN and had then reprogrammed. The next room looked as though the door had been busted down MULTIPLE times as the lock was barely hanging on to the wood and there were holes in the frame where it looks like it had been kicked down. There were a lot of strange people around who appeared to live there as well. I'm assuming the cockroach on the kitchen counter also lived there.The room had no trash receptacles whatsoever and the heater did not work which made for a rather cold sleep as it was between 40 and 50 degrees out that night. I had 2 nights booked and decided to check out early. I slept on a couch in the airport the next night waiting for my morning flight and was much more comfortable and felt much more safe than I did at this hotel.Absolutely would tell everyone to steer clear of this hotel at ALL costs."
__label__positive	This hotel was clean, quiet, and the parking was very close to my room. It was nice to have a heat lamp in the bathroom, because it kept my week old baby chicks warm during the night. There was a good Mexican restaurant adjacent to the hotel, which was very convenient.
__label__very_negative	Worst experience ever. I booked two nights, I stayed 10 minutes. The walk way up to the room smelled like urine. The room itself smelled disgusting. I saw some things that I'm pretty sure... I guess I'll leave it at that. It's an unsafe place. I felt like I needed to be on high alert. From the beginning I was uncomfortable, unwelcomed. I do not recommend this hotel at all.

__label__very_positive	Overall a very good experience. One small issue with bed linens. Nice view from the riverfront rooms. Nice restaurant/lounge as well. Friendly staff all around, It's the place to stay in Bay City, Michigan.
__label__very_positive	we had been traveling on the cheap for a few days, staying in kind of dumps when my bro said he would use his points and spring for rooms for us all. fantastic place although it would have been better if the pool was outside. it came with a real full hot breakfast. well worth it.
__label__neutral	The hotel lobby was gorgeous and the staff was great but there was a lot of construction being done to the hotel. The first room we got had a issues with the front door being able to close securely. We were given a second room which had the electrical messed up. When the kitchen light was turned on, the bedroom closet light also turned on and the bathroom lights were also connected to the other kitchen lights. The coffee pot did not work either even though it was plugged in. The room was very nice though and clean. I believe once all the construction and updates are finished it will be a very nice hotel.

__label__positive	Like always I do a research before I stay in any hotel. I will tell you that the choice I made was accurate. Room was really clean and the bed was super comfortable. Hot breakfast was buffet style with a lot of options and front service was excellent. Definitely I will be back if I have more business around the area.

__label__positive	The Hampton is a well-staffed and inviting hotel. Overall, I had a very pleasant stay. The double queen rooms have no refrigerator though, which is strange to me seeing how even the cheapest of motels have fridges in all of their rooms. The rooms are clean and well-maintained, the beds are comfortable, the staff are friendly. 4 out of 5
__label__very_positive	Not worth the 18 drinks, and unfriendly bouncers/management I am very disappointed with the treatment we received at the Hudson Sky Terrace, while celebrating my 30th birthday....There was no music at all, after it was promised that there would be music via an IPOD.... The staff was telling me that they were bringing speakers up, for an hour and a half, and then they never came, and the manager basically said their IPOD ran out of batteries Meanwhile, 50-60 people showed up and spent a lot of money at the bar, which was also ill-prepared for the crowd as there was a line of people waiting to be served, for the majority of the evening. The most disappointing part of the evening took place toward closing time when some of my guests were not allowed back onto the terrace, because they were in the process of closing, and had the doors slammed in their face (even though some of them were still running a tab at the bar). The bouncers were unfriendly, unnecessarily aggressive, and acted as though they were herding cattle, not people. And the manager, who could not have been less accommodative if he tried, did not so much as utter a word of apology. Needless to say, my 30th birthday celebration was not what I expected, at all. The space is pretty, but there is no upside to coming all the way there, to an obscure area on the 15th floor, to be treated as though they are doing you a favor for allowing you to spend your hard-earned money on 18 drinks!

__label__very_positive	We were pleased with a 1-night stay in this hotel. The renovated rooms are very nice, clean and pretty large considering it's LA. This hotel used to offer free parking and now since it's been renamed 'the Kinney' they only offer valet parking for 15. Not super expensive but I would have liked it to be free as I booked it when it was The Inn at Marina Del Rey which offered free parking. The only thing that was not great was the fact that the lobby, corridors and some common areas were under construction. The front desk area smelled of fresh paint and there were constantly workers around. Breakfast was surprisingly good, with scrambled eggs, bacon and a waffle station, with a very nice lady attendant. This hotel was about 15 minute walking from Venice beach and restaurants located next to it.
__label__negative	overpriced. Paid for location, not quality of room. Room was small with a kitchenette that looked like it was from the 60's! Closet had freestanding metal shelving that looked tacky and didn't fit the large closet. The closet was bigger than the bath! Floor of room was concrete with only one rug and NO aircondioning. This was a warm weekend,so to cool down room, your only option is to open windows and let in more noise! Website us not forthcoming about bath/shower choice. We had a room with a shower I am disabled and need a tub. Front desk could have switched us with a couple checking in but they did not. ..said it was too late! I'm sure had Justin explained the situation, the couple would have switched. We had an outside room 28 right by construction on mason st. Loud and irratating! Free breakfast was only bagel,muffin, danish and cereal. Coffee orange juice milk were choices for beverage. For the price of this room, expected a better breakfast. upon check out, front staff didn't ask our care whether we enjoyed our stay. I travel to Santa Barbara every 3 months for doctors appt and have stayed in alot of different places. I definitely will not stay here again!

__label__neutral	Hotel Cadenabbia was overbooked and moved us to Hotel Mennagio. Service was OK but the room had an upstairs bedroom that was difficult to access. The TV was small, had limited channels, was difficult scrolling through the channels, and mounted in a position that was uncomfortable to watch. The bathroom was clean but only had a bathtub with a handheld shower head and no shower curtain. The food in the restaurant was adequate. The hotel was located in a nice setting on the coast but had a bar next door that was extremely noisy which made sleeping difficult. We would not book this hotel again.
__label__neutral	It was worth the price, it was clean, I felt safe and the staff was very friendly. It was simply an older hotel, nothing fancy, felt dated.
__label__neutral	Really disappointed. Reserved a king size bed. Got there 1 hour after check in, they was sold out of King size beds, they gave me 2 queen size beds. Also room service knocked on door at 8:00 am Saturday morning. One knock then 1 sec later door opened that is was house keeping. Not cool at all.

__label__very_negative	The hotel is nice I'll give it that.but we got NO sleep cause they put us on the first floor...sadly the first floor is all the pet friendly rooms. No one told us! After driving (not walkable) into town to find food and entertainment we got back late and after lying down neighboring dogs began howling and barking. It literally went all night long as if they were left in the rooms by themselves. Was horrible! We had no pets with us so no reason to of been stuck on the pet friendly floor. In the morning at check out (cause we were told at checkin no other rooms avail hotel was full) the clerk laughed to herself about it and said yup that happens on the first floor a lot. Ugh. Was horrible had to gonto work meetings tired and exhausted cause we got no rest. The hotel overall is the only one I would stay in that are but on another floor.

__label__neutral	The room was very nice. Staff was as helpful as they could be. There were a couple of things that I was VERY disappointed by. First was the breakfast. They had no eggs!! I have allergies and could not eat much else. I was looking forward to a hot breakfast in the morning. Also I understand that the rooms need to be cleaned but not while I am sleeping.. I was still asleep and they started to vacuum the room above me.
__label__very_positive	The Staff was outstanding and the service was excellent.
__label__negative	We arrived late and was very disappointed with the appearance and location of the hotel. It loozed a little run down and the luggage cart was filthy. We had no choice but to stay because we wereally told that if we didnt,they we would still be charged 172 because they held the room for us. There were cigareties burns all over the jacuzzi, and my husband had to kill and flush a huge bug that was in it. The towels were old, dingy and brittle. The deadbolt on the front door didn't work. And,the patio do didn't have any kind of security lock, although the patio was adjacent to another room. Which meant if we had left our things there to go sightseeing, the people in the adjacent room could've easily broken into our room and stolen our things. To add insult to injury,the hotel charged my credit card twice and I had to call them about it and then wait days for them to return the other 172 that I clearly needed to pay for another hotel, since I was on vacation. The overall experience was very disappointing and caused a serious decline in the quality of our vacation...

__label__very_positive	This mammoth entertainment complex draws more tourists than Graceland, and for good reason. The SceneBilly Bob's Steak House Saloon boasts it has the biggest Angus steaks in the Delta, but of course that's not the main draw at the entertainment complex. Sam's Town Hotel Gambling Hall has become one of the largest tourist attractions in the Memphis area (in terms of people it pulls in) due to its nationally known musical headliners, as well as its gambling action. The Old West-style casino has a million square feet that includes the 1,600-seat River Palace Arena, where acts such as Wynonna and Willie Nelson draw top ticket prices. Two sports bars with big-screen TVs also feature entertainment and sporting events. Then, of course, there's the table gaming, slots, and casino atmosphere that have made Sam's Town synonymous with good times and entertainment.Must Have DrinksGrab a beer and let it ride.

__label__neutral	We did not realize it is a dog friendly hotel and there were lots of dogs, including a yappy one right next to us. But I called the front desk and they took care of it. I am allergic to dogs but did not have any problem in our room. The breakfast service was horribly slow, both getting seated and waiting for coffee and food. Who wants to wait for coffee I finally got my own out in the hallway. . . . Our last morning we just skipped breakfast because we didn't want to wait.
__label__neutral	Sjour agrable, dans un environnement joli et verdoyant bien entretenu.
__label__very_positive	shoebox rooms and zero service Our room was the same size as the bed but they still managed to position the TV so it was impossible to see from the bed. Where is the design That would have been ok but the service was non-existant starting with the bell boy upon arrival, to the check in, to the maintenance service (or lack there of) to management. Was put on hold 30 mins on the phone for waiting to ask for maintenance person who never showed up. The Manager's hospitality skills offered only that I should wait like everyone else.... nice. Run away!!!
__label__very_positive	Suite not very comfortable
__label__positive	A day off
__label__very_negative	One of the worst places I've ever staid at. Beds were awful and it looked nothing like advertised
__label__very_positive	I got so high on potnuis
__label__very_positive	great day before flying rest
__label__positive	One of the things I value about Hampton Inns is the predictably clean, and well appointed rooms. This place is no different, and was substantially less expensive than many others in the area. And, I really like that there is a good breakfast and hot coffee 24/7. The staff was friendly and helpful too.
__label__very_positive	Great Stay
__label__very_positive	Great for the Money
__label__very_positive	Have always enjoyed the Indianapolis 500 race but have never stayed the night before or night after due to cost and traffic. After staying here this past weekend, it's going to be our place from now on. Quiet! Restful! Clean!
__label__positive	Average

__label__very_negative	i bring a small travel fan and don't have trouble with the train.
__label__neutral	not your typical Comfort Inn. It was Ok for a night, and best thing off that exit
__label__positive	Overall ok...
__label__positive	We love this hotel and Grand Jct. Have stayed here multiple times. Very central location. Walking distance from shops and restaurants. Staff works very hard and tries even harder. Seriously these girls bust their butts to make you feel welcome. If you are staying in the Grand Valley, I encourage you to check out this hotel./
__label__neutral	Very beautiful lobby and rooms! The bed was really comfortable and room very clean. All the staff were very nice and it had a pretty descent breakfast. The only down side was that the pool was closed for maintenance our whole stay and the elevator was pretty slow.
__label__positive	It was worth . We enjoyed stay at super 8
__label__very_negative	Chaos
__label__very_negative	Their 2 bed suite is really a 1 bedroom with a studio. The walls only went half way and it wasn't really separated.
__label__positive	Anniversary getaway
__label__positive	Great value
__label__positive	Hotel was generally excellent. Sea view rooms looked great. Our room was on the side and had a terrible view of unsightly side of hotel next door. On reflection we should have asked to be moved but didn't bother as only there for a couple of days would definitely be worth paying more for the stunning view of port and cathedral. Had breakfast one day which was very good but quite expensive at 29 per person-would have been cheaper if we had included breakfast when we booked. Room facilities v good. Good wifi in room, lovely bed. Quite a long walk into town but very easy to hail a taxi if needed and not expensive at around 5. Would go back.
__label__very_negative	Stinks, dirty, they don't wash the bed spreads or towels after guest check out. All rooms are smoking evening the non smoking rooms. No body checks the clealiness of the rooms or clean the mold build up. The toilets and tubs are griry and Grimey. Yvonne is clueless. Sandy the manager is the cousin of the general manager with no customer service skills. The health department need to shut the bed bug hotel down. We slept on chair due to the time of night and nastiness.
__label__very_positive	Great stay convenient to downtown Annapolis!
__label__very_positive	Good choice!
__label__very_negative	Great customer service. Extremely friendly and helpful.
__label__positive	Holiday Inn Spearfish-Convention Center
__label__very_positive	Fantastic Hotel
__label__very_positive	Happy we stayed at the Hyatt House!
__label__very_positive	The hotel was very clean, the suite included a kitchenette and a huge bathroom. The location was directly across from the convention center. The check-in was very easy. Breakfast was included and had nice variety of items.
__label__very_negative	Hotel was alright
__label__very_positive	try staying for two weeks you will really learn to hate trains....
__label__neutral	Clean Room, Easy Access to Highways
__label__neutral	Overall the hotel was okay. The room was fairly clean but did have issues such as wallpaper coming lose from the walls in the bathroom. The lady who set everything up for breakfast was very rude to guests when they would ask a simple question like where certain things were located. She would go into a long explanation as to why she places items where she does. All of this was completely uncalled for. This occurred on two separate mornings so this was an indication to me that she does this all of the time. When I went to check out there was a problem with getting a receipt for all there nights that I stayed. This made no sense to me when a coworker of mine who had also booked my room had no problems getting a receipt for her complete stay. I have stayed in many Hiltons over the years but after this stay, Hiltons will no longer be at the top of my list for accommodations. This saddens me greatly!
__label__positive	The food at the Patio Cafe and Riverrock were especially great!

__label__positive	Pleasant stay
__label__very_negative	Only reason this establishment got a rating of one was because of its complimentary breakfast spread. Otherwise we where made to wait more than an hour and a half for our room at check in. Hotel desk staff was not very considerate to its guest. No one kept us updated or showed any concern. All the staff says is ... More
__label__very_positive	Nice Place
__label__neutral	Bit of a ride from airport but good thing is number 2 bus, stops in front of hotel. Staff were warm and accommodating. Breakfast is alright with bread, cereals, cold cuts etc. Our room is quite hot even when air conditioning was on. All in all, will be happy to stay again.
__label__positive	Good experience
__label__neutral	Chose this hotel since it had a kitchen and 2 bedrooms. Stayed for three nights. Overall, it was an okay experience with the exception of the first day. Came in at the end of cleaning carpets (for all rooms in the hotel). Took about a day to dry. Manager called and apologized for the inconvenience. Bathroom tub was dirty and didn't drain well. Bed sheets had stains. However, these issues were handled very quickly and professionally. Great continental breakfast. Exercise room small (two treadmills). And it's pet friendly.
__label__very_negative	Poor check in.. Staff was unable to check us in in a timely manor.. Reserved 2 rooms neither one was ready at check in time.. Staff made no effort to accomadate us . Ended up having to take one room. Would not recommend this hotel
__label__very_negative	GROSS!!!!!
__label__negative	All the area BnB's were filled so this seemed lime a good alternative. It's a tired property that's overdue for a rehab. Let's see - one magnetic key didn't work, the bathroom light wouldn't work without a noisy fan, the tub wouldn't drain properly, floor lamp had a broken plug, I killed a large insect, and to top it off, the wireless internet didn't work during the duration of our stay.Best thing that I can say is that you have a great view of Orange County Choppers from the parking lot.
__label__neutral	Decent for a one night stay
__label__negative	The hotel staff was very friendly, very nice and it was very quiet. But I would not recommend or stay again at this hotel again. The room had a terrible overwhelming mildew smell, a very large stain on the carpet and dead bugs in the bathroom. The breakfast was coffee/bagel/toast/waffles/cereal only, the juice machine was broken.
__label__very_positive	Fabulous property and wonderful service - great stay all around
__label__positive	In mei ben ik ook al in dit hotel geweest en wat mij nu dus opviel was dat het leek of iedereen ontzettend moe was, op het tandvlees liep en het hart voor de zaak kwijt was. Ook de verzorging in het restaurant mag meer aandacht. Als de tafellakens verwisseld worden liggen er vieze en vettige rode lakens onder, het serviesgoed is niet schoon of nog nat en veel messen hebben een verbogen punt, waardoor je bij het brood smeren de boterham kapot trekt. Een uur voordat het ontbijt afgelopen is worden bijv. de tomaten niet meer bijgevuld, de aangebroken fles wijn van de vorige dag is niet meer terug te vinden MAAR er wordt na 10 minuten zoeken wel een nieuwe fles geopend. Service aan de balie geweldig, de bar biedt veel vertier in de vorm van flamenco-avond enz. en het kijken naar de nederlanders met hun kaart/rummyspel zonder een drankje te gebruiken is opzienbarend. Je zou je schamen nederlander te zijn. Kamers zijn ruim en schoon, maar je ziet dat de dames van de schoonmaak wat meer tijd zouden mogen hebben zodat ze ook met een stofdoek kunnen zwaaien. Dakterras geweldig!!!

__label__negative	Not very clean
__label__positive	I stayed at this hotel for a conference. Everything was great. The rooms are lovely, the meeting spaces were great. The food was also very good. I was very pleased with the overall experience. They do an excellent job with conferences as well.
__label__positive	If you are looking for a clean, quiet place to stay, this is it. True, it is older and not fancy but the beds are comfortable and it is quiet. I appreciate a microwave and a frig in the room. It is also a bonus to be able to park your car right in front of your door if your room is on the lower level....no elevators or hallways to haul luggage down! This is our 6th stay there and we will continue to do so...why waste money on a fancier place....unless you can't love without glitz!
__label__neutral	You are paying for the view.... and it is a great view
__label__very_positive	Nice Venue but Poor Service Since I live in the city, this review is not for the hotel itself. I came here for a social night out on a Friday night. Huge turnout and luckily I got here early! The venue plays good music and it is quite spacious but the drinks here are midtown prices. Also, my friends got here a little before 12 and they waited in line for really long time and they wouldn't let them in unless they bought a bottle. Terrible way to do business. It is a shame.

__label__very_negative	Faux 4 toiles il vaut peine un 3, le site internet est trompeur on s'attend arriver dans un belle htel et la dception est grande en y arrivant. La chambre classique est horrible on a l'impression de loger dans un motel ( les matelas on s'y enfonce, trs mauvaise insonorisation) et la salle de bain celle d'une aire de repos. Le personnel au bar/restaurant incomptent et mal poli par contre la piscine rien redir toujours trs gentil et accueillant. Bilan du sjour nous n'y retournerons plus jamais et dconseillons vivement cet htel.
__label__negative	The hotel was not well maintained. Corridors were cluttered with construction work. The mattress was extremely soft. The air-conditioner was barely adequate. Our room was dark and out-of-date. The whole place seemed dispirited.

__label__very_positive	Our stay here was great overall. The room was clean, nice and up to date. The only problem we had was the a/c. The fan would shut off and on about every 3 minutes.

__label__negative	I stay here because I like the location. It's walking distance to downtown shops and restaurants, as well as the college campus. I've stayed before and it was decent, but this time it looked like blue toothpaste was left in the sink and on sink counter, so I don't think the bathroom was cleaned before we arrived.

__label__very_positive	We stayed there for a convention.. Very clean and comfortable.. Breakfast was outstanding.. They had an evening meal for guests as well.. Hotdogs, baked potatoes, chicken of some type, nachos and then they had pop and popcorn every evening.. We saved quite a bit of each day by eating at the hotel.. Well worth the money.

__label__neutral	The hotel room was a lotttt smaller than I thought it would be. We ordered room service and there was a hair in the crab cake! Then it took an hour for us to get any kind of manager or staff member to actually help us. Once we finally talked to someone that could help, Kevin, he was extremely short and unpleasant. When we came down for dinner at the restaurant he didn't address us but talked to every other table around us. Hotel was nice, amenities even nicer but I was disappointed at the services especially given how expensive everything is!

The location is super convenient, the cabin amenities are first-class, the cleanliness is perfection and the views are amazing. I have stayed in other cabins in Gatlinburg and theirs are by far the best. Whether you are planning a romantic weekend for two or a 10-person trip, they most definitely have a cabin that will meet and exceed your needs. Almost Heaven might be my favorite thus far! I just went last weekend and I cannot wait to plan my next trip...I will absolutely be staying at Elk Springs Resort! Seriously, best Gatlinburg Cabins!!!
__label__neutral	Ho hum stay Room okay food very lacking
__label__positive	Room had staples all over carpet, picked up about 13 so we wouldn't get them in our feet. There were blood droppings leading from refrigerator to door. I cleaned it up. Refrigerator wasn't plugged in. Guess if the head of housecleaning had done a run through after room remodel this stuff would have been caught. I still give the hotel a high rating as they usually are great, I'm understanding in the middle of remodel. :)
__label__positive	This is a reasonably priced location with nice rooms. There is an excellent restaurant right next to the location, Timber Creek which is a micro brewery. They have a pool for those that like swimming. The free breakfast was really excellent.
__label__neutral	Seems like I have a hard time finding a proper hotel in this area. I'm an fully aware that it's not the 4 seasons, but this hotel is a bit pricy for its condition. Its clean but past its prime, needs an upgrade, fresh coat of paint it serves it purpose, but I thought should be cheaper. Then again, seems par for the course in that area.

__label__very_positive	We stayed at the Monaco from 7/5/11 - 7/7/11 and were really pleased. I have stayed at many 5 star hotels and had not-so-great experiences ... this one was a breath of fresh air.From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, everyone was always smiling, pleasant and very helpful. We were checked in very quickly and our room (two double beds) was big, very clean and smelled nice. The bathroom was so sparkling clean that my son (who is very picky) couldn't wait to take a bath (FYI, we are generally shower people.) Yes, the a/c unit can be loud, but when you're tired from a day of sightseeing and full from a big dinner ... all I can say is that I slept very well. I personally would have preferred a firmer mattress but that is really the only complaint I can make. When I realized that I had left my toothbrush and showercap at home, I called the front desk and housekeeping was at my door in 5 minutes with complimentary toiletries. As for Wi-Fi, just sign up on their website to join their club (no charge) and you will get your internet for free. I even read that you can get coupons for some free mini-bar use.My brother and his wife were on the trip with us and their room, with a king bed, was smaller than ours. Being from Europe, they are not fans of a/c to begin with and the loud noise theirs was making made it hard for them to sleep. They finally called guest services to complain because they couldn't turn if off either and were immediately moved to another room (just to sleep in) for the night. The next day while we were out, they had an engineer come in and fix the unit. By the time we came back, it was working fine and there was a bottle of wine waiting for them for their troubles.I did like the decor of the lobby ... colorful and eclectic but in a nice way. The location itself was great because it was so close to great shops and restaurants. There is a french cafe next door which was great for breakfast. We tried dinner at the restaurant downstairs ... although my dinner was good (bucket of fried chicken), my brother felt that the ribs and BBQ chicken were a bit dry. Overall, not worth the money we spent. The wait staff, however, was very efficient and friendly.The next night we tried an Italian restaurant up the street ... Bartucci's. This place was great! Their pastas were homemade and the seafood was fresh and cooked perfectly. Great wine selection also. This place was worth it and we will definitely go back next time we are in town.Overall, I found our stay very satisfying and reasonably priced. Checkout was quick and they even e-mailed me my bill. Based on my experience, I would definitely go back and I would recommend this place without hesitation!

__label__negative	Let's start with the positives. Great location to everything and the staff were super friendly. Now the negatives. Dated and a bit worn, not to my liking and certainly not to my wive and kids either. There were bugs in the room. The kind that fly and some in the bed. We were very displeased and embarrassed. I will not return.

I owned a timeshare myself but my stay at Elk Spring Resort helped me understand the real meaning of being on vacation. I loved this place and will go back anytime in heart beat. Clean, great customers service, and very relaxing place.
__label__negative	This hotel was a pleasant surprise. It was very safe and comfortable and I would stay again. We bought the park and cruise package and overall had a great experience.

__label__neutral	Attractive hotel very near the theatre we were attending, comfortable, clean, friendly staff. We were disappointed not to have food and drink more readily available, nothing during the day.
__label__very_positive	We had a good experience at this hotel. It was quiet, clean, and comfortable. Certainly a good value for the price we paid.A few minor drawbacks: no miniature fridge in the room; the dining area for the continental breakfast was way too small, with not enough seating room for all the hotel guests having breakfast(or attempting to do so). But we stayed during a holiday weekend(Columbus Day), so perhaps on most other days it wouldn't be a problem.The staff was courteous and helpful. I would certainly stay there again myself, and would recommend the hotel to others also.

Although the lift is small, not a big thing to me. I treat it as my VIP lift only, it is ok if just me and my luggage stay in the lift.
__label__neutral	Expensive for the price
__label__very_negative	This hotel has a lot of potential, but it's so broken down and dirty. The rooms are set up nicely, but it looked as if the room hadn't been cleaned in decades and everything was just falling apart. I'm definitely never staying here again.
__label__neutral	Wonderful place to stay
__label__positive	Check in was easy and desk clerk very pleasant. Room on the other hand was a little disappointing. Beds hard and pillows flat and tired looking. Bathroom in need of renovation tub and mold or mildew around lip. Sink stopper didn't work at all. Pool and deck looking a bit tired needs some work.

__label__very_negative	Very filty and was stinking like there was a water damage and the house keepers dont clean the rooms. This hotel uses cheap toilet tissue and it leaves crumbs of tissue inside you. Make sure you take your own tissues towels because towels are like rags. The room size and setting is nice, but needs to be clean and maintain.
__label__very_positive	I realize hotels are expensive in the area but I did expect more. I was there for three nights and on the second day no one from housekeeping even serviced the room. I had to call the front desk at 8PM just to get towels. The elevator carpet was grimy and never even vacuumed in the three day period. No breakfast, no shampoo in the room. No fun-
__label__negative	it's alright for the price. u might have unwanted friends that live with you though. they have roaches that live with you for free. if they gone be in there with me at least pay half. I could have gotten two beds. one for me and the other one for them.
__label__neutral	Nice pool, LOUD air conditioner
__label__very_negative	The hotel was easy off and on the highway, and reasonably priced, which were our main points for selection. The night clerk was very helpful for our issue. But that doesn't outweigh the huge negative of finding a condom wrapper between the sheets with suspicious spots on the blanket, which led us to believe they had not been changed from a prior guest. Upon my request, both were replaced and we were offered a different room, but inspection of this room included holes in both the sheets and blanket. Disgusting. If I hadn't booked on line I would have insisted on my money back. We would never recommend this hotel to anyone!

__label__very_positive	My parents came to visit, and we headed to Olympic National Park. We called to reserve a room at the Sportsmen Motel. I am always a little wary of strip-mall type motels, because, in my experience, they usually seem to be seedy/druggy/scary. So, when we got there, we asked to see a room first. I was pleasantly surprised. We stayed the night, and not only was the staff (a mother and daughter) very friendly and accommodating, giving restaurant recommendations (try Blue Flame BBQ a few bu...view moreildings away...oh.my.god.), but the room was cleaner than my house (really clean), the second bed had its own locking bedroom, and there was a full kitchen, with a big fridge, pots and pans, plates, coffee and coffee maker, etc. It was 90, including tax, and I was very impressed.

__label__very_negative	I've been in many hotels and have never before stayed in one with no place to store clothes. There was the usual rod and a few hangers but no dresser. Very odd. Fridg was stored on a shelf way above your head and made noise like an airplane. Room overall was dismal. Took a shower and the water wouldn't drain! On a happier note, service to unclog drain was not too bad. Service person said drain was full of hair. Hmmm..... not attended to in quite awhile, I'd imagine.

__label__positive	An over night stay on the way to the Oregon coast. Be aware that the pool echoes into the rooms above but closes at 10 PM.
__label__negative	The hotel rooms were ok because it had a full size fridge, small stove, microwave, etc. The rooms were very old looking and only had 1 really old TV that was faded. It was cool in the living room but hot in the bedroom since it only had an area AC unit. The water pressure in the shower was a joke...and they kept 3 small towels in stock. We had to ask for extra towels each night. I was really upset when I went to take a shower and all that went down. I did like the swimming area and the employees were pleasant.

We only stayed because most of the other hotels we booked. when we got there the face sink had dirt in it and there was alot of soap builtup and the vanity counter was dirty with hairs i called hotel.com to leave because i didn't feel comfortable staying there, i waited on the line and hotel.com told me that the hotel says they would have to charge me for two nights stay if we choose to leave. I would definately not dear to stay at this again.

I don't think they ever used detergent or fabric softener to wash the linens!They were that horrible! I had to spray the linens with perfume so I wouldn't smell them 'au naturel' while I'm sleeping! I'm never going to stay in this hotel ever again!

__label__positive	The people above us were really loud. The floor stomping was over the top. The view was not at all as expected since all we could view was the gondola. The only other issue was lack of privacy as the folks that were on the gondola could see right into the room. I confirmed the view into the room from when my husband and I took the gondola ourselves. Perhaps the place was clean because you had the experience as though company was coming and on thei way.
__label__very_positive	Top notch decorating and ambiance, very clean, comfortable, nice bed linens...quiet for the most part. I had one bad evening where a party was down the hall at 2 a.m. The hotel staff was fairly responsive, though the party-throwers were not!

Wouldn't been nice to know ahead of time so we could've planned to use the kitchenette instead of eating out. Older hotel, could use some updating. Carpets need to be cleaned. Staff was very kind. Would be helpful if they knew more about restaurants in the area. We were scheduled to be on a bus tour at 9am in Glacier Park and needed to have breakfast before, however the staff didn't know what restaurants were open early enough to get breakfast. I would stay here again only because I know more about the area now.

__label__negative	Was one of the worst rooms I've had to stay in
__label__positive	We were pleased with a 1-night stay in this hotel. The renovated rooms are very nice, clean and pretty large considering it's LA. This hotel used to offer free parking and now since it's been renamed 'the Kinney' they only offer valet parking for 15. Not super expensive but I would have liked it to be free as I booked it when it was The Inn at Marina Del Rey which offered free parking. The only thing that was not great was the fact that the lobby, corridors and some common areas were under construction. The front desk area smelled of fresh paint and there were constantly workers around. Breakfast was surprisingly good, with scrambled eggs, bacon and a waffle station, with a very nice lady attendant. This hotel was about 15 minute walking from Venice beach and restaurants located next to it.

__label__very_positive	We recently stayed for 3 nights and were very happy with the hotel. The room was comfortable and very quiet. Having a microwave and refrigerator in the room was a welcome (and well used) benefit. Front desk staff were helpful and courteous. Housekeeping staff were also friendly. The Library/Business Center was user friendly and comfortable. The only thing that would've made the stay better would be having room service run later at night.
__label__very_positive	I can't say enough about the staff and how accommodating they are for their guests. The consistently go above and beyond. This is my third time staying at this Comfort Inn and I'll be back again in June. The beds are more comfortable and you have an option of a soft or firm pillow with each bed. The shower head offers different water pressures and they recently changed their security system for all their doors. You can't beat the service for the price of the room.

__label__very_positive	We stayed at this Best Western because they will shuttle you to the cruise ship. We were shocked at how nice the room was, and the breakfast a nice bonus. Our shuttle driver Martin was great . We called to be picked up and he was prompt, courteous, and very friendly.
__label__neutral	One big security issue ... entry door at the rear of the hotel does not close so virtually anyone can enter without benefit of a room key. Front desk does not have line of sight to that door. A bit disconcerting. Also might be about time for a pest control call - couple of dead 6-legged visitors.

__label__very_positive	The suite was very comfortable and the room in excellent shape. I also notice the cleanliness of caulking and grout. Hyatt place is as good as the best I've seen. The room was quiet and the HVAC was silent. I was disappointed to not get a bathtub in the king bed room, but the shower was large and, as I've said, very clean. Breakfast was delicious. We were up a little late and didn't get down until close to 9 AM, so the pancakes were a little dry. But, the breakfast sandwiches were delicious. Nice selection of juices, including tomato juice, and delicious coffee. Matt at the check-in desk was very helpful and cordial. Definitely a place I would want to stay again.

The GOOD:  views from Times Square view rooms are decent.  Bed is fairly comfortable.  Staff tries like heck to help.  Very good gym with great views. The BAD:  room service food and menu selection, room decor and bathroom. The UGLY: elevator service is terrible.  Those ""clueless tourists"" can't seem to understand this relatively simple elevator system and THAT causing most of the delays.  The check-in is a zoo.  And, of course, the ridiculous amount of fanny-packed tourists who can be heard complaining because they think they are staying in a 5 star hotel....LOL. Funny note:  saw several ""Apprentice"" rejects step on the elevator and look disappointed when nobody acknowledged their minor celebrity.  They didn't even merit a stay at Trump Int'l Hotel....?"

__label__neutral	Hotel was off the strip, but close to a shortcut to downtown -made it easier to avoid some of the traffic. When I was checking in, lady had a meeting or something to get to, so I felt like I was inconveniencing her. Her replacement was ok, not really friendly, but not rude. Staff was better the next day.

One of the best accomodations we had during our holiday in Florida!
__label__negative	Didn't expect alot from an inexpensive room. However, in my reservation I stated there were four people staying. There were not enough towels for four people. Called the front desk in the evening for a wake up call, in the morning for more towels and in the morning for toilet paper (only a small amount left on roll, no spare roll). The phone was never answered. Had to go to the front desk to request each thing. Next morning went to the Continential breakfast only to find it ended at 9am, on a Sunday.

__label__very_positive	We were there Dec 22 to 28, and had a fabulous time. We arrived an hour or so before check in and were told we cold get a room right away, or wait for a nie upgrade to a room with a terrace. We were expecting a juliet balcony to peep out on adjacent buildings, but were amazed to discover a huge terrace (20 foot by 30 foot) complete with plants, chaises and a table. We had an incredible view of the Grand Canal and the Salute Chapel. Greeted with proseco and fruit, it was a great start to the visit. The rooms were large and well appointed, cleaned daily and very comfortable. The staff was gracious and always available, including 24 hour consierge.

__label__very_positive	We spent Friday - Monday at the resort. I would highly recommend this place. It is one of the best resorts on the Cape. The pool area is great, the beach is so relaxing with shade trees and/or sun. I particularly liked the caribbeean music with Margaritaville radio playing. Unfortunately, the pool and poolbard close way too early - 6pm. The firepit is great at night. Rooms are good, but the A/C could be a bit stronger. Breakfast was good, but only ate it once. Went oout twice for breakfast instead. Needed a change over waffles and premade muffins. Although, I can definately see it is a great value for families with kids. The housekeeping staff was very friendly. Bartender could be friendlier though. One thing I was not thrilled with is when you order lunch at the pool, it is called down to a local restaurant next door and delivered. salds were VERY soggy fries were cold by the time we got them. As I said, we will definately be back.

__label__neutral	The staff was very friendly but the room was very outdated and for the price I paid It would have been nice to have more. the toilet was not attached to the floor and while I was away on my first day there it flooded. The staff moved us to a nicer/remodeled room but the hassle and the invasion of coming back to your room that you left a do no disturb on, having the curtains open to the whole world and the lights left on was a little unsettling.

__label__very_negative	DO NOT STAY HERE. It is the worst, most dangerous place I have been. The rooms were filthy and it seems that they must rent by the hour by the people that were coming in and out of the place. I did not stay there because I was worried about my safety. I left the room the same day and did not return. The carpet is filthy and sticky, you cannot take off your shoes. The fridge was frosted over with ice and rusted. The toilet paper holder was the back of the toilet. There was no holder, just toilet paper sitting on back of the toilet. There was no phone in the room and after my second time asking for a phone, the person said she had to put in a work order, because people take phones out of the room and they don't know it's gone. It is not a safe place. I was told by a worker that the reason WIFI doesn't work in all areas of the hotel is that someone cut the power lines while trying to steal it. I would have more pictures to upload but my phone died since I spent about an hour on it trying to find a safer place to stay.

There was free wifi and plenty of room for pups to be comfortable. Definietly worth the price. Will be back again.

__label__very_positive	The staff was pretty rude. I arrived early, as they told me I could and to my surprise the room was filthy and they didn't replace any of the previous sheets, toiletries, etc. it was absolutely horrible. Especially for the price I paid. The location was awesome, right on the beach. Since it was a rainy day, it was extra gloomy because it's on the beach.
__label__neutral	Could be cleaner and more updated for the price. The maid kept coming by knocking on our door every 15 min. until we checked out. She did this for an hour before check out time. We were early check out because of this! Annoying maids!! ugh!

__label__very_positive	Simply wanted to check out downtown Denver for a few nights after spending a week in Boulder and the mountains around Estes Park. What a gorgeous city! I spent hours walking through the incredible Botanical Gardens. Then walked up to City Park where I played some pick-up volleyball, walked around the lake and listened to a free Sunday evening jazz concert! What fun! Am quickly falling in love with Denver.

__label__negative	Air conditioner didn't work til I played with the buttons for 10 min, toilet had remnants in it from previous guest, bed spread and sheets had stains on them, rates had been jacked-up to triple what a motel of this poor condition should cost because there was events in the area that gave people no choice. (This is where the term highway robbery comes from) Motels like this should not be allowed to charge 170 for a room under any circumstances, we checked out when we found out they wanted that much for a second night.
__label__positive	the hotel was good but the A.C. starting in the bottom waitin area to our 10th floor in the 3rd tower was warm n elevators were hot, our room's a.c. unit was not that great either but just dealt with it cause the hotel was booked..other than that overall experience is great
__label__very_positive	If you are looking for a good place to stay when you are going in out (quick trip) of Tucson, the Holiday Inn at the Airport is the place. No issues with room, clean, comfortable, wifi worked well, no waiting time for check-in, breakfast, and next to airport.

__label__very_positive	Very nice!!
__label__positive	Stopped here on the way from Grand tetons to the Badlands. Good place to stop d/t the town had a grocery store we could restock and refuel. Very dissapointed in only one thing: the hot tub was not even bathtub temperature. We were so looking forward to this after four days of hiking/camping before 3 more days of hiking/camping. told the front desk worker about the problem and she said she would look into it but it didn't really help us bc of only staying one night. do not know if the problem was resolved or not.

__label__very_negative	For starters, the lady at the front desk was very nasty! Me and my cousins had went down for a bachelor party and we wanted to check in. She told me we couldn't check in as soon as possible. Before I walked out of the lobby she told me not to ask to check in again until 3 PM! For someone who is paying their hard earned money to stay at a hotel that's the last thing should of said to me. Then when I did check in she asked me who is going to be in my room. I told her that my cousin will be in my room only to change and hang out before we left. She then proceeded to tell me she was going to charge 40 because someone else was going to be in my room, which i refused to pay. When I didnt pay the extra 40 she threw the paper and the key and walked into the back room. I will never ever stay at that hotel, and i will never recommend it for anyone either. Save your money people. Its a dump hole!

Their room on 1st floor near the center of activity by the lobby breakfast area. Easy for the family to help them enjoy the reunion. A near by conference room was provided. When we all met in the AM for breakfast, (could have been overwhelming for staff, as we did not think to inform or ask for a large group rate). We then could all sit together visit, without disturbing the other visitors. By the way, better than average breakfast was included in the room price. hours (7 to 10AM). Staff very friendly, did not stress as we all started arriving in the breakfast area. Thank you for the pleasant experience.

__label__very_negative	Horrid - the tv didn't work. despite the unique directions given by the staff. More importantly, the water valves in the sink and bath did not operate properly. I had to climb under the sink to shut off the water (CA drought conditions!). Staff seemed indefferant on the morning, saying Why didn't you call us at 10:30 pm. No adjustment on the bill, of course. Miserable experience and we will never stay there again.
__label__very_positive	Better than expected
__label__positive	Good nights stay
__label__positive	My room was very spacious and clean. The location is great with Fremont St right out your door. The rooftop pool and bar was very nice and bartender and security staff very friendly. The casino itself is lacking and needs updating there is just no life in there compared to other casinos in the area.The Internet seemed to work very well. Overall I would stay here again.

They didn't treat me like a customer, they treated me as a friend.
__label__negative	Meh, not going there again.
__label__very_positive	Between the desk clerks and the breakfast lady, i don't know who was friendlier. The room was nice and the whole place still had a new feel about it. There are multiple places to eat nearby and if you like to walk, you can walk to the mall.

__label__very_positive	Suddenly without a place to stay, I was fortunate enough to get a room at A B B in Cambridge. The guesthouse exceeded my expectation, to say the least. The staff is super friendly and serves guests delicious creps for breakfast! Everything is neat and clean my room was good and the kitchen a clean and cozy place. While I stayed, it was very warm in Boston (around 30C) but a controllable AC in my room made sure I felt good the whole time. The wi-fi is better than in most hotels I've stayed in, and the location is perfect - almost on the Harvard campus. I would definitely recommend the place to anybody looking for a friendly place to stay in Boston.

__label__positive	We stayed here for our trip to DragonCon. We specifically picked this hotel because of the great rate on Hotels.com, and the close proximity to the MARTA station. when we arrived, we were given a king bedroom, but it didn't include a sofa bed, which is what we specifically booked since there were three of us sharing. The staff quickly remedied the situation and got us in the correct style of room. The room was very clean and comfy. The shower is a bit strange in that the glass only goes halfway across, so water spills out and soaks the floor/bathmat. Also, there's not much space to put your shampoo, etc. The continental breakfast was pretty standard, but our one complaint is that they didn't always have everything set up by the time breakfast started. The area around is pretty quiet, and you are within walking distance to the Perimeter mall and another shopping center with a grocery store and restaurants. All in all, it was a great hotel and we would definitely consider staying there again in the future.

__label__very_positive	Without a doubt, one of the finest hotels for incurable romantics is the Hotel Monaco. The Lobby is exquisitely decorated in opulence and style. There is a cozy living room fireplace in the Lounge area that features wine tasting daily from 5-6pm. The rooms are just incredible. My room had a soft pad that you could use as a window seat. This place is absolutely fantastic and I would recommend this place to everyone.

__label__very_negative	Check-in was a bit slow, not horrible. There was not a square foot of carpeted lobby, hallways, conference rooms not crawling with ANTS!!!!!! Thank goodness I didn't see any on the 4th floor. The hallways were teaming with screaming kids until I shut them down at 10:00pm. I understand there was a wrestling tournament, and there is a swim park next door. All the same, don't fool yourself into thinking this is a classy hotel. Their lounge (Barleycorn's) didn't have a single craft beer. Bud, Budlight, Miller is about the full selection.Box pizza you cook at home is FAR better than they serve. The wings were barely passable. The 3 sauce selections are all weak. Morning coffee at the Largest Starbucks in Michigan, didn't open until after 7:00am. I ordered a medium strongest flavor they offered, with a double shot of espresso. Honestly, if was watery weak. I didn't risk trying their breakfast buffet. VERY disappointing overall. If NUWAY wrestling competition is held here again, I'll sleep somewhere else.

En recepcion me obligaron a pagar a la llegada la estancia de 3 dias, a pesar de tener todos los datos de mi tarjeta de empresa. Para utlizar el garaje, tienes que dejar un deposito de 30 euros en efectivo, no admiten ni siquiera la tarjeta de credito. Los muebles de la habtacion penosos y las zonas comunes del hotel, les hace falta una reforma desde hace 30 aos. Viajo por toda Espaa y hacia tiempo que no pisaba un hotel asi. Nada recomendable.

__label__very_positive	"We got married at The Abbey on Friday June 10, 2016. We had our ceremony at the Harbor Gazebo, cocktail hour on the waterfront patio, and reception in the Harbor Ballroom. We cannot say enough good things about our day! The entire day my husband and I just kept looking at each other and saying ""this day has been so perfect"" because it was!! We worked with Tabby and from beginning to end she was amazing to work with. She was always very responsive to emails and very organized. She made the entire planning process painless and fun! We worked with Claire to book our room blocks. She was also wonderful to work with, very responsive and professional. The food was outstanding considering the volume of these meals that they make. We had the Sea Bass, the Chicken Fontina and the Vegetable tower. One of our guests told me after the reception that the chicken ""may have been the best thing I have eaten in my entire life"". How cool is that?? I've been to other functions at The Abbey before with different menu options and the food was outstanding then too. Another plus, we had a lot of guests with various nutritional restrictions (gluten free, nut free, dairy free, vegan, celiac's). We had every kind of restriction imaginable it seemed like for some of our guests. Tabby assured us that all of them would be accommodated and none of the restrictions were a problem. Whatever our guests needed, they would make it happen. And they did!There are so many other wonderful things I can say about our day and The Abbey and their staff but there isn't enough room! We can't imagine having our wedding anywhere else. Our guests were blown away by everything the entire weekend. We would recommend The Abbey everyday of the week. If you want a classy venue, attentive service, and great quality The Abbey is a must for your big day!"

__label__very_positive	In many ways, this is a typical German hotel in a convention city. It has a great location near the Dom and train station, there are many places to eat and drink a short walk away and it is clean and efficient. However, after staying in many of these types of hotels over the years in Cologne, the An der Philharmonie really stood out. The people at the front desk were fabulous. They were extremely friendly and helpful with anything I needed. My bag was delayed, so they told me specifically about good places to shop for what I needed. When things needed to be printed, they asked me to email them to them and it was taken care of. The breakfast was very good and very inexpensive (4.50 euros). The room was not huge, but was larger than most of these types of business hotels. I received a double bed which is much preferred over the single bed and there was plenty of room to work. The internet worked very well and the hotel was quiet, despite a room that overlooked the street. Overall, I was very impressed with the people, the accommodations and the value for the money despite having a show in town. I'll be back!

__label__very_positive	The facility was beautiful and the view from our balcony was amazing. The hotel staff were very friendly during check in. They upgraded our room to accommodate myself and my two children. I was a little disappointed that the rec center with the pool and splash pad were so far from the room. It was about a 5 minute drive into a residential neighborhood. It seems as if the hotel shares the rec center with the neighborhood next to the hotel. However, it was a very nice pool area and there weren't very many people. The pool furniture was very nice and there was a snack bar. Overall our stay was amazing!

__label__positive	Not Very Cordial While the website looks great and the backyard is like it is shown on the website, it is located right on a highway and the noise from the road is a factor. We flew in from the east coast and arrived at the Millikin Creek Inn around 3:00 PM, hungry from a day of flying and had jet lag. With that we asked if there was a nearby restaurant (the Inn does not have one). They sent us to a quaint place called Don Giovani's. Great food and atmosphere. Now the story about Millikin. We went to bed early around 6:30 PM because it was 9:30 on the east coast. Well needless to say we were up at 6:00 am west coast time. While walking around in our overpriced room we got a call from the owner (Sunday Morning at 6:45 saying we were bouncing around a making too much noise for the guest on the floor below us. Needless to say, I explained that going to the bathroom did not constitute bouncing around and suggested she fix the acoustics in their room and not blame the guests paying over priced rates. We said we would leave but she did not want to give us our money back for the second night. That night a wedding party showed up and we listened to them on the floor below making noise and taking a Jaccuzzi at midnight. Needless to say, it spoiled our trip to Napa. I would not recomend this Inn. Mush better places elswhere.
__label__positive	great place for the price, good free cont breakfast in the AM. close to the beach and shopping if needed. clean bed and sheets, nice size room, many have balconies. the outdoor pool is nice, in May 2015 it looked as if they might be adding an outside bar area.

__label__negative	The Best Western San Marco is not with the stay. We were driving up the coast and decided to stop in Morro Bay. This was more of a convenience stop as opposed to a destination stop. The hotel is just a block away from the beach so it's convenient however the rooms don't have air conditioning which is very odd... More
__label__very_positive	Up from Austin to visit Ft. Worth's cultural district, we selected this hotel because of access (IH 30) and location - close enough to the cultural district, TCU, and even downtown -- with the bonus of a shopping mall located across the highway. The staff, room, breakfast, and WIFI were great. I would definitely recommend.
__label__very_positive	Fantastic gym, looking at Broadway ave. Right there in timesquare!
__label__very_positive	This place rocks!
__label__very_positive	Great hotel and close to the beach.
__label__negative	DO NOT accept room 103 if offered by the front desk. The mattress is well beyond time for replacement and is actually breaking down along the edge where visitors have frequently sat. When I described the very poor condition and resulting awful night's sleep to the front desk, the reply was a kind and thoughtful I'm sorry to hear that. The more appropriate reply for a major complaint should have been, I will be sure the manager receives your comments as soon as possible. Ken W.
__label__neutral	The empty room next door alarm clock went off at midnight and it took almost a half hour after a call to the front desk to turn it off.
__label__neutral	Not bad for an overnight. Clean, accommodating and being upgraded although we did not get a new room. Ask for a room with mini-fridge and microwave. We were tired and did not get one. Cracker Barrel next door, and easy to call and get pick up if you have a pet.
__label__very_positive	Service was great. You were Wedding Central for a large family and it looked to me like every one had a comfortable stay!
__label__negative	Never Again
__label__positive	Spend the extra to stay next door
__label__very_positive	Great Place
__label__very_positive	From the welcoming get acquainted tour with Bill to the gourmet breakfast by Beverly, everything was wonderful. We had a great time bird watching, and just relaxing in the beauty of the surroundings. The bed was SO comfy! However, the best thing about the entire stay was the kindness of Beverly and Bill
__label__positive	Would stay here again

__label__very_positive	Traveled to Wyoming, Colorado , and Black Hills for work and play. This was a great hotel and was the nicest stay our trip. Cracker Barrel is across the street, best meal I ever ate. Excellent continental breakfast. Extra bonus was I had request reward credit .
__label__very_positive	very nice large rooms-very comfortable
__label__neutral	Close to Space Needle
__label__positive	The hotel staff was extremely friendly. This hotel was completely full due to displaced people from Hurricane Matthew and it appeared they were working extra hard to accommodate such a large occupancy. Breakfast was good, but only 1 salt shaker for the entire dining area was a bit of a problem. The only other downside is that the parking lot is not well lit in the evening and if you are a single lady it's a bit frightening to walk through when you return in the evening. Something really should be done about that!
__label__neutral	A decent place to stay
__label__neutral	Musty smell, small rooms
__label__neutral	There is something a bit odd when you walk into a hotel to check in and the person at the desk, in this case a middle aged man, by the look of it, does not smile or give you a friendly greeting. We were not dressed up as we were coming from a construction site. That should not have mattered.... More
__label__positive	Everyone was very friendly. Breakfast area a little crowded. Overall a good stay.
__label__negative	The staff was friendly, but the facilities were outdated and rundown. The carpet looked like it hasn't been vacuumed for a while, and the ceiling had accumulated a nice layer of gray lint and dust. The lamps are old and they should check their lights when cleaning to replace light bulbs or lights that aren't working. Furniture is kinda beat up. The bed was comfortable and sheets were clean and the bathroom was clean.
__label__negative	Beautiful but disappointing
__label__very_positive	We booked a return stay at the Mendenhall Inn because we knew we would receive wonderful accommodations, service, and delicious food. We were not disappointed. Everything exceeded our expectations , and we were delighted. It is conveniently located for visiting nearby Longwood Gardens, Winterthur, and other attractions. If you choose to stay here you will be pampered, and leave being very refreshed.
__label__neutral	Loved it
__label__positive	Older hotel shows signs of wear and tear. So close to the boardwalk you can see it, smell it, and hear it. Great location for fun at the beach.
__label__very_positive	We had driven ten hours and really needed sleep. Our room was clean and comfortable and had a fridge and microwave. Staff were very nice.

__label__very_positive	I went to Seattle last night to see a band at the Neptune theater. (directly across the street from the Deca) The gentleman, Charles who was working was extremely helpful, and honestly the friendliest guy ever. He personally made sure that my friends and my stay was superb. I would definitely recommend this hotel to everybody.
__label__very_positive	Great stay.

The manor itself is a very large circa 1906 house that includes the dining facilities downstairs and bedrooms upstairs. The decor of the rooms reflects the era in which... More
__label__negative	I'd skip the breakfast.
__label__positive	The hotel was pleasant. I gave the cleanliness only 3 stars bc there were two dirty towels on the night table when we arrived. The room itself was comfortable, we enjoyed the sitting area which had a big tv.
__label__very_positive	The staff was great,very friendly! Get a suite with the Fuji soaking tub! The Girlfriend and I stayed here for a romantic get away. The suite with the Fuji soaking tub was a bit pricey but well worth it! Will def stay here again!! Walking distance to some good restaurants. If you can't park in the front of the hotel for valt, circle around to Pitt street for their garage entrance. tThere's another entrance to the hotel as well!
__label__very_positive	No smelly carpet, excellent. Rooms clean and spacious. My second visit, in same room, I enjoyed my stay. I look forward to visit you again next time. You can be sure that I will stay in your hotel again.
__label__very_positive	The staff was very friendly and customer focused and the hotel is well maintained and nice. I would recommend staying at this hotel especially if you have any business plans in the downtown Columbus area.
__label__positive	Hotel is well maintained, and staff was very pleasant. Breakfast was decent and a number of choices were available. The hotel was nice and quiet despite being in a busy area. The location was very convenient to what we needed.
__label__very_positive	Our family totally enjoyed staying at the Hotel de Ville in the center of the historic city of Florence. The staff was friendly and helpful in a variety of ways. The rooms were clean and well furnished. The hotel breakfast was a particular favorite and really set us up for our exploration of the art and history of the city. The concierge desk provided us with excellent information and was very congenial and approachable. Overall, it was a very positive experience and we recommend it heartily.

__label__very_positive	Pleasantly surprised, as my expectations weren't very high. Bed was super comfortable. Nicely redone bathroom with granite. Very clean. Would definitely stay here again.
__label__very_positive	We just stayed at Bayshore for 9 nights, and had a great time. I wondered if staying on the marina side would be as nice as oceanfront, but it was great and a perfect fit for my family. The pool is a nice size with a deeper end, and the water temp was warm and pleasant--almost too warm on a... More
__label__very_positive	Convenient and comfy
__label__positive	Stayed one night in this hotel while in town for a family members funeral. Overall good experience. Nothing extra special but all was good. When we were in the parking lot about to leave we saw that there was a hiking trail in woods right next the hotel. We are very pleasantly surprised and very much enjoyed the little trail
__label__very_negative	The room was in much need of new furnishings and renovation. The carpet and corners of the carpets were filthy. You could see where items like the door lock, shower rod, and toilet paper holders had come down and then replaced without spackling and repairing of the wall. On the last night we were locked out of our room because the computerized door lock wouldn't read anyone's door card, even the management's card, and they knew all day that it needed fixed. It was not worth the price per night that we paid. The only perk were that the beds were comfortable, parking was free, and there was free wifi.
__label__very_positive	Hotel Monaco was absolutely phenomenal and provided the highest quality service to both the human and canine guests. The front desk was warm and inviting and the room was five star quality. The hotel provided our dog with her own doggy bag and provided ample pet friendly information for the surrounding area. Having had bad experiences with other hotel chains (i.e. Marriot) we cannot express enough our thanks to the Hotel Monaco and Kimpton Hotels as a whole. There is no doubt we will seek out this chain of hotels for all of our future travels.
__label__very_positive	Good quality rooms, excellent location
__label__very_positive	A must stay
__label__positive	The subs are amazing, and the cannoli is the best I've ever had.
__label__positive	Had a wonderful 4 days here. The front desk clerks were very helpful and pleasant. The housekeeping policy was clearly explained when we checked in, and we had no problem with that. Clean towel and sheets were always availble.The room was spacious and comfortable. Can't wait to come back
__label__neutral	Room is too crowded with furniture! I was told that there was a 24 hr. airport shuttle and when we checked in we were told it did not operate until 5AM and we had a 6AM international flight so that wasn't going to work for us. I informed the desk manager that I was very unhappy about the situation and he arranged for a cab to pick us up at 4AM and paid the cost. It is absurd to have limited times of service for a shuttle to an international airport when so many flights leave in the wee hours of the morning. Think this needs to be rethought!
__label__very_positive	Exceptional Staff
__label__positive	Where do I start the bath room sink drain real slow. False advertisement on the continental breakfast, the room had roaches and other insects. The room didn't have an iron. I had to put a $5.00 deposit to get the iron. I got my money back afterwards. All around I didn't enjoy my stay.
__label__very_positive	Great location, helpful friendly staff, convenient shuttle to the parks
__label__very_positive	I very much enjoyed the stay. The hotel was convenient to the exit, no driving around lost. The room was clean and comfortable. Very nice and pleasant.
__label__positive	Nice place to stay. Almost affordable. Staff at front desk were very helpful. Eggs and coffee at breakfast could use improvement. When we arrived the internet and televisions were down. However, they were up and running within the hour.
__label__very_positive	Good location, really nice and clean place. My whole family...
__label__positive	a pleasant surprise !!!
__label__positive	Stayed two seperate nights, Sunday and Friday, midway point of trip. This hotel has obviously had a recent renovation and upgrade. Rooms were large, clean, comfortable. Bathrooms well appointed modern and clean. Despite being near the airport and major roads, the rooms were very quiet. Easy access from I-84 and I-87. This hotel has been underrated. Perhaps most pf the ratings preceded the renovation. NOTE: For handicap accessibility,request a first floor room. No elevator, but first floor corridor is accessible from the lobby, no steps. NOTE 2: Restaurant next door is separate from hotel. Not recommended.
__label__very_positive	Disneyland is walking distance from this hotel. you can buy tickets in the lobby. Overall great stay. Rooms are spacious and big bathrooms makes it easier for families with kids. Really nice and helpful staff.
__label__neutral	The neighborhood is crazy with tourists and vendors and the hotel is just above the water taxi stands -- creating noise at all times. The hotel is lovely and the staff is great. I think they over sold the junior water view suite however, which was actually an attic build out and a bit disfunctional -- hard to use the suite area given the layout. No real shower in the bathroom, just a stand in the bathtub.
__label__neutral	Best Acommidation and Staff Ever!
__label__very_negative	I was told I was getting a free upgrade but the room was simply horrible. There is a stale, mildrew-like smoking type smell throughout the areas I venture i.e. room, hallway, breakfast area and even when you walk thru the front door. I knew this was going to be a problem but the registration was nonrefundable. NEVER AGAIN!
__label__very_positive	Nice, very clean place. Comfortable bed. Great price and a very good breakfast.
__label__positive	Excellent location!
__label__very_positive	Nice facility
__label__very_positive	Peace be still
__label__very_positive	The hotel was right off the highway but not so close as to experience traffic noises. The room was nicely decorated and very clean. I have stayed at a lot of hotels this year and this one by far was the best. Great bed. Slept like a log and woke refreshed. We ate at the in hotel resteraunt and were extreemly pleased. overall A++

__label__positive	Pro: Great location close to the cathedral and the river promenade Breakfast (7 Euro extra) was excellent - large variety We only stayed for one night on the way to the Netherlands, so we did not make any plans, but the staff was very helpful in giving suggestions on what to do. Con: Room service did not have hair conditioner, shower was small Would definitely come back.

__label__negative	Good value for being walking distance to beach
__label__negative	To see friends. Location was great. Hotel employees were great friendly. Physical building and room was a 2 on a 10 scale. Poor condition, shabby but clean. Tattered bed covers, broken bathroom tiles. Poor lighting. Poor conditions all around. Paid 105 per night worth 45 at best. Won't stay there again.

__label__very_positive	Great stay
__label__very_negative	I stayed for 2 nights. When we arrived, the room had hair and dirt on the sheets on one of the beds. The mirror on the bathroom door had hand prints all over it. The nightstand had smears and a ring from cups sitting on it. The bathroom floor had nasty hair on it. The next morning, I mentioned the room was not clean and asked that it get special attention that day to get cleaned. When I returned later in the day, the only thing cleaned up was the hair on the bathroom floor. But that was easy to do since I had swept it up onto a white tissue so that it was very obvious to see. I am extremely disappointed, especially for the price I paid. For only 5 more per night, there is another hotel nearby with a higher star rating. I won't be staying here ever again.
__label__very_positive	I travel for work all the time, so I stay at more hotels than I'd like to admit. This location has friendly staff, clean rooms, and great service. Overall, my experience was very positive! I will definitely stay here again the next time I am in the area.

__label__positive	We were recommended to this hotel by friends who have stayed twice in the past. We were travelling with 2 teenagers and the extra space was appreciated.

__label__very_positive	Clean and friendly staff
__label__very_positive	I was here on business, for the most part. Everything was going well, until last night. On my last night I decided to go to bed early, so I took my medication and as soon as it hit me the fire alarm on my floor started going off. I had to go down to the lobby to find out what was happening, and then my key decided not to work. So I had to go back down again, and have security take me back up. I was completely exhausted, and security was on top of it! Thank god for them! I will stay there again, that's for sure, Jeff Rutkin
__label__very_positive	Nice Stay!
__label__positive	I checked in staff was very friendly. Nice underground parking one way in one way out. In view of the front office. Very well lit. Property was very well kept no trash or graffiti anywhere. Room smelled clean nice big TV microwave and refrigerator. I felt very comfortable. It's not a high end hotel by any means but it's clean and comfortable. I will be back. My only complaints the breakfast and a night security person would be good just for peace of mind. The area is older and a few undesirables are walking the streets at night.
__label__positive	Late night stay.

__label__neutral	Not bad, but nothing special. The front desk was helpful, elevator was extremely slow. Breakfast was ok, standard hotel fare.
__label__very_positive	We just returned from another perfect stay in Cancun at the Excellence Riviera celebrating our anniversary. It more than met our expectations again! It was great to meet others who were also returnees! The staff are what makes Excellence stand out above others. Everyone greets you...whether pulling weeds from the landscape, emptying trash bins or serving you directly....the smiles and greetings give you a feeling of joy. We stayed 7 days and were not disappointed with ANYTHING! Lots of folks avoided the beach due to the seaweed but this is nature's doing and not Excellence's. However, they tried to remove as much as possible and we got into the warm water despite the ugliness of it and feeling. Once we crossed over the slimy stuff and got out past the seaweed it was good. However, the lazy river, pools, and jacuzzi hot tubs were as great and relaxing. If you are looking for a place that has excellent food (all the restaurants are 5 star and amazingly wonderful), excellent service, super cleanliness, serenity, yet ability to enjoy some water sports, facitlity games, relaxation, outstanding shows in the evenings, no kids ( I love kids but not on my vacation), adult only---- then this is the place for you. Shout out to the Lobster House Horatio....treated us like royalty!!! Chez Isabelle (French Restaurant) and Basmati (Indian restaurant) were my two new favorites. The housekeeping staff kept our room spotless and comfortable. The drinks are good...not watered down..Enjoy!
__label__neutral	The room was decent. We were close to the beach without having to deal with all the noise of the beach. There was nothing spectacular about the room but it wasn't dirty and that's what I was most concerned about. It's very much a you get what you pay for situation.
__label__positive	I recently stayed at the Candlewood Suites in Moore, Oklahoma and was very pleased with my stay. The lady at check-in was very helpful and also with check-out. The rooms were very clean and smelled fresh. The rooms have a full size kitchen and a flat screen TV. The beds were exceptionally comfortable and cozy. This is definitely on of the best places to stay in Moore, OK. At times parking can be a little full, but this just goes to show that a lot of people must love staying here for the parking lot to be that packed! I will definitely stay here for my upcoming visits!!
__label__neutral	The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. The room and facility was spotless. The restaurant was terrible. I made the mistake of ordering one of the specials, prime rib. It was without a doubt the worst prime rib I have ever eaten or should I say tried to eat. Our server asked how it was so I told... More

__label__very_positive	Cozy room and comfort food...just right!
__label__neutral	If you're looking for a hotel where the action is, go elsewhere. The hotel is on the Lido, which is about a 10-15 minute waterbus ride away from Venice. However, if you're looking for a place on the Lido, this is a well-priced option. The staff was great with handling/recommending dinner reservations, even during an insane Carnevale weekend. The doors are a little thin and since the building is old, the soundproofing needs improvement. The quarters are cramped, but the room comes with breakfast. If we wanted to stay on the Lido again, this would be a good option, but next time I think we'll opt for a place closer to the action. Recommended.
__label__very_negative	This was by far the worst hotel that we have stayed at. Even called the front desk last night to get a late checkout from 11am to 1pm and he said the best I can do is 12pm bye and hung up on me. This was after we had them switch our room as it was dirty and had a small comforter on a king size bed with no blankets. All though they did upgrade us yes with a charge of course, the new room had three throw pillows on the bed. No pillows other than the three throw pillows. Do not waste your time here. Also couldn't utilize the hot tub or pool area as none of the doors are restricted with key entry only the whole neighborhood was in there and they ordered food to be delivered. THEY WERE NOT PAYING GUESTS!!!

__label__negative	The Hotel is close to the expressway.
__label__very_negative	I was very disappointed in this hotel.The pictures online are very deceiving and was not what I expected. At check in the lady at the front desk was very rude and inconsiderate, she proceeded to tell me before say hi or welcome SIR booked a handicap room and I told her that is not what I booked online and she says yes it is and that's what you are getting and if you don't like it I don't know what to tell you. In my mind I was wondering where I was at and if I was the customer.I stayed here the staff was very rude and one employee was standing in the hallway listening people in their rooms. The rooms were dirty and had a smell of old dirty laundry the room service ladies were very sweet, but that's all the good I can say about this place.
__label__very_positive	Highly recommended
__label__positive	Need sheets that fit! Our sheets didn't fit our bed. Doesn't feel good to have to make your own bed while you're out of town. The front desk clerk, Chelsea, was great! Very nice and understanding.
__label__very_negative	THE STAFF WAS RUDE,UNEDUCATED AND DISRESPECTFUL. THE HOTEL'S CLEANLINESS WAS APPALING. I WOULDN'T LET MY DOG STAY THERE. THE BBB NEEDS TO SHUT THEM DOWN AND BULL DOZE THE PILE OF BRICKS BEFORE SOMEONE CATCHES A DISEASE

__label__very_positive	Home away from home
__label__very_positive	Luxury experience.
__label__positive	this hotel was great the young lady at the front desk was able to check me in 3 hours early! I drove in during a snowstorm managed to make it in early and was able to get into a room immediately that almost never happens anywhere else! the hotel is clean very large rooms spacious and accommodating the bed slept amazingly well! the breakfast was great the staff was very friendly and helpful didn't matter who or what time of the day I went down to speak with them. my only negative thoughts on the property would be the Direct TV crystal clear skies we had no signal off and on all day on the History Channel. the other negative would be park in the parking lot is very tiny however there is overflow parking across the street and that was not too big of a hassle. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone needing to stay in that area.
__label__negative	The only plus was that it was right off the interstate if you're traveling through. The hotel itself was pretty bad. The room was dirty, the beds uncomfortable and there was such a bad smell in the room we could barely sleep. It was noisy too, and the bright lights from the parking lot lit up our room all night, even through the curtain. Pretty horrible place.

While all other front desk staff apologized, Jamie took it upon herself to call local flower shops around the city to see where they came from and if they could be broughten back. She kept in touch with me and even had champagne and chocolotes broughten up to the room free of charge. Flowers arrived the next morning and put a smile on my girlfriend's face. Thank you, Jamie!

__label__neutral	We arrived at midnight, there was no one at the front desk. I had to call the number to get someone to give us our room key. The room was dirty and the beds weren't made yet. We had to wait for 30 min for the beds to be done. The maid couldn't run the vacuum because of the late hour so all she could do is sweep and clean the bathrooms. The room was a good size though and the maid was friendly. It was to bad it was dirty and not cared for.

__label__negative	Simple hotel, near Universal Studios
__label__very_negative	I have to give this hotel a negative review. The reason why is they would not valet park my Mercedes Sprinter van. So I had to park at there overflow parking lot down the street. I have no problem with parking there UNTIL I find out they charged me 20.00 a day on top of my room cost. The manager said she could do nothing about the parking charges. And just a note they had oversized spots in the valet lot.

__label__positive	Convenient Hotel, close to the Airport. Hotel Suttle was excelent! Room comfort needs improvement.
__label__neutral	The staff was very help, nice and knowledgable. The facility is a bit run down, not the cleanest. A bit over priced for the size, amenities and quality of the room. Had no parking available, had to use a sister hotels parking and we had to carry and walk our luggage two blocks. No compensation or assistance for inconvenience. Valet parking was a joke, took us over half an hour to get open spot to drop car off with valet. Not worth 20 of parking!! If offer parking, should facilitate all of your own guests. Was there for a concert, excellent location for concert at the key arena and with walking distance of several restaurants.

__label__very_negative	The electricity went out in the room. The front desk made perfunctory but unsuccessful attempts to restore it. The parking area could not accomodate all the cars so we had park in unauthorized areas. The breakfast area was so crowded that tables were doubled up. When I pointed some of these issues out to the manager on call I was advised to take up any issue with the provider through which I booked the room. I cannot wait to go back.

We were treated as special guests.... More
__label__neutral	The room itself was nice, but the service was disappointing. We arrived about 1045pm after a full day car ride and were told by the lady at the front desk that she was doing her night audit and we could not check in until 11pm when the next worker arrived. We sat around and waited until 11 (when all we wanted to do was go to bed) and when the next worker arrived she proceeded to complain about all the work she had to do with all the check-ins that night (we were in the area for an event so I guess they were more full than usual). We were finally able to check in close to half an hour after we originally arrived. The room itself was nice, but one of the reasons we chose the extended stay was for the kitchenette. The kitchenette was nice and clean, but there was nothing stocked in it. On the website, it appeared there would be at least some basic stuff in the unit, but everything (including a coffee pot which most rooms include even without a kitchenette) had to be ordered from the front desk and at that point we didn't want to deal with the front desk staff again. When we checked out in the morning, we had to wait again at the front desk because the 2 workers were talking in the back and did not acknowledge us until we had been waiting for close to 5 minutes and finally had to ask them to let us check out. It could have been a much worse experience, but I doubt we will go back again because of the poor service.

__label__negative	It's a motel. For 30 a night I wasn't expecting much. The owner is very friendly and so was the housekeeper. My biggest problem was the bed. It was hard as a rock. I literally woke up because my hip was sore from laying on my side. And the main office smells like some kind of musky oil and it just stayed with me the whole time. I didn't like it at all. I did like that it is a smoke free, pet free property. Here is a few ideas to make the place better. New beds, pillows and blankets, new paint in the rooms (get rid of those bold colors, no-one likes them in a bed room, not calming or relaxing) and stop with the oil or whatever that smell is and I would def stay again.
__label__very_positive	Good stay
__label__neutral	Great Memories, Great People! Sutton Bay is a Beautiful resort and we have found it to be extremely family friendly, clean and affordable. Management is always helpful and our experience has been that there is NO tolerance for underage drinking or out of control drinking of any kind for that matter. Managements goal is clearly to provide a fun, safe and clean atmosphere for families to spend the day, week or even summer camping, fishing, swimming or hiking. They (management) have devoted their life to this cause and this is clearly evident. We look forward to many more memories at Sutton Bay and it is our opinion that any negative postings came to be as a form of retaliation from a person or persons that either had trouble following the simple rules or were refused service for a valid reason, almost always for the protection or consideration of the other guests. Thanks Wayne and Linda for making us a part of the Sutton Bay family!!

__label__very_negative	When ckecking in the clerk was rude, we arrived later at nite and asked for more pillows the nite clerk was watching tv, she gave us pillows and we had to put on the pillowcases, (the pillows were stained). The room was cold so we turned on the heater only to have the fire alarm go off, we had to open the window because the room stunk so bad. Called the front desk and was told was because the heater hadnt been used yet, and was told that she would bring us a portable heater, we waited for about a 1/2 hour and finally called down to front desk and her reply was she was she was doing bookwork and had forgotten. She then called us back and told us that she couldnt find one, we were told to take fire alarm apart and try it again. We didnt want to chance anything getting thing broken, we were told that the manager would call us in the morning and he never did. Upon checking out we asked if there would be any compensation and were told that because we had spent the nite and didnt leave that we still owed full price (we didnt have any other options).

__label__very_negative	This Hotel is not Worthy to carry the Hilton's name. The doors closing mechanisms are defective so every time some one leaves or enter their room it sound like a loud door slam. We came back to our room at 3:00 AM to sleep The room is freezing cold the AC is blowing cold air when you raise it to 80, I call the front desk they said that there is no maintenance person in hotel and offers to send extra blanket because there is no more room available in hotel I refused. To verify that i am saying the truth he send the security to check the system. Security comes and plays with buttons for 10 minutes (when we are sleepy)I ask him is there any hot air coming out of the duct he answers no i told him why you are wasting time go down stairs and tell front desk to change our room. again the front desk tell us there is no room available in hotel so I told him that I will dispute the charges on my credit card,now he said let me check some thing he has a room available the room in exactly in front of elevator I refused and he said again there is not any more room available. I inform him about my dispute. magically he finds another room. This hotel has very dishonest employees that only think about profit not the comfort of their gusts.

__label__neutral	Our room, in bldg. 5, was well worn and out dated. We only stayed for one night and did not use the kitchen appliances but would not have used them for a longer stay as they seemed unclean. The carpet was stained and had runs in numerous places. The outside vanity area was ok but the interior of the bathroom was very bad. There was a large patch in the ceiling that the fiberglass webbing was still visible, it was not mudded and finished properly. The caulking around the tub was gross. It was obvious that the previous caulk was not removed or cleaned but that a new bead of caulk was placed over, poorly. The curtain rod was extremely loose and I was afraid to place my towel on it after showering as I was afraid it would fall. The tub fixtures were loose and the tub spout itself was at a 45 degree angle when we checked in. The bed and bedding were mediocre at best. Again, I was only in the room for a short time so I did not give the hotel an opportunity to rectify the problems but I feel any room that they may have moved me to would have had similar issues. I will be staying in the Dayton area for the next 4 years as my children are attending UD but I will not return to the Hawthorn.

__label__very_positive	Wonderful. Gondolas in Telluride are free. Leave car at hotel and ride the gondola to Telluride village. The hotel staff really treated us as special guests.
__label__very_negative	It was the cheapest in the area (although still expensive)...but it was a horrible stay, we were able to cancel our reservations for the last 3 nights and able to get a hotel across the street. Ok. The place was completely outdated, which I could deal with, but it wasnt well kept and maintenance of any looked like it was done by someone who had no idea what they were doing. Such as the bathroom plumbing, there was no cold water, at all. There was very little water pressure, that meant the showers were scalding hot. The room smelled, the small Ac units did their job, but if it were summer I would doubt it. Honestly the worst hotel experience of my life.
__label__very_negative	Adequate for a quick overnight stay and thats it

__label__negative	When we first looked at our room, it looked as expected. Clean, etc. When we used the bathroom however, I noticed that everything was very very low to the ground: toilet, shower sink counter--So much so that I had to bend my knees and strain my back to reach my hands under the faucet to wash my hands. Kind of annoying since standard counter height for bathrooms now is 36. This counter height was around 26-27 high so I was not happy with that part. Also, water pressure was very low--so that was also annoying. When I woke up---I had bites on my arm that weren't there the night before when I went to sleep. When I went to check out in the morning -- I told the hotel employees about this. The man behind the counter said that since I booked with Hotels.com, they weren't able to do anything compensatory like a discount, etc. First of all---I never asked for a discount or compensation. Besides, it's not a Hotels.com issue---it's a Best Western issue! Later the manager did call me and thanked me for letting them know. He said he would call me back after a thorough room inspection. He never did. Two days later, the bites are still there---but are now healing. I was grossed out and worried about bringing whatever that was back to my house! Also--breakfast was practically inedible. They were out of everything anyway because they were super crowded due to the end-of-breakfast stampede. Suggestion--extend the weekend breakfast hours or start later on the weekends.

__label__very_positive	Just an overnight stay after attending our grandaughter's first dance recital. The room was fine. Just wish the fitness center was open 24 hours a day.
__label__positive	We stayed at this hotel with our two cats. The hotel was very accommodating and we had no problem settling in our room. We noticed several  guests with dogs. The only down side was that even though when we first arrived there were no pet smells, by the time we left a few days later, the hallways had a definite dog sent. Not pleasant!
__label__very_positive	Great place to stay!
__label__very_positive	I've been to the Lobby twice, once on Friday and again on a Monday. Friday was crowded with lots of noise, people, and goings on. Just what you want on a Friday!Monday it was sedate, almost serene. Just what you want on a date. My lady friend and I had the short ribs to warm up, then I had the Lobby burger and she had the pork tenderloin. Other than a little too much onion on my burger, the food was superb! My date who is normally hard to please was giddy (she doesn't cook and she wanted the recipe).
__label__very_negative	Vandalism
__label__negative	I booked the 2nd time and stayed some days private with my partner and some days for business. Regarding to the 1st stay (one year ago) the situation changed in the worse direction: Even I'm a re-booker and I booked early with the wish to have the room in the direction to the quiet garden side (like last year) the hotel put me to the street side which is horrible loud even in the night which makes it impossible to sleep with open windows. The breakfast is very poor in the scope and in quality. One day old and hard bread, another day the broken coffee machine. Lot of times empty plates in the buffet have been refilled not till we asked to do so. But the worse is that now there are cats allways in the breakfast room. I really like cats and they are sweet but when guests first touch them and later e.g. the bread of the buffet that is far away from simple hygienic roules. Other guests (e.g. with allergy) will be amused very much.

The man who checked me in didn't say hello and wouldn't take my ID and credit card when I handed it to him - he wanted me to verbally tell him my name so he could look me up first. He handed me a key to the room and a map, and sent me on my way. No information about breakfast hours, gym facilities or anything else. He was quite a ray of sunshine.
__label__very_positive	We stayed here last Labor Day 2014 and wish I could stay here again this 2015 Labor Day. It's a great hotel, with a great location.

Quickly resolved, but still a hassle and the reason for less than 5 stars

__label__very_positive	Chocolates awaited my arrival. Room service answered promptly and brought my meal within 20 minutes. Perhaps by looking at my identification card, the hotel discovered that it was my birthday and a bottle of champagne appeared. Taxis were called before I could voice my request. The room was nicely appointed. I walked by while the cleaning staff was refreshing my room. One lady was wiping down the mirror behind the headboard. I have never witnessed such thorough cleaning! I would not hesitate to stay in this hotel again.

__label__positive	Comfortable place
__label__positive	The room was clean, bed was comfortable, breakfast very satisfactory. The fact that a good place to eat was across the parking lot helped greatly also.
__label__neutral	We stayed for 6 nights. Mostly because of the price and location. We visited Sonoma and Napa primarily and had about a 30-40 minute drive to each. There are also some good breweries within 10 miles. Our favorite was the Cooperage Brewery. PROS Good Location. I got a courtyard room and it was quiet. The bathroom was also clean. Make sure you get a Courtyard Room if you don't want to hear traffic noise all night like I read in other reviews. CONS The carpets needs to be cleaned! After taking my shoes and walking around in the room, I stepped on the towel in the bathroom and my foot left black marks on the towel. Even after showering and washing my feet I would walk barefoot on the carpeted floor and then step on the towel again and black marks again. The bed was a bit hard and small. We reserved a queen but I think they put us in a double. Or somehow my queen bed at home is bigger. The shower head limited the water pressure which made it difficult to rinse all the soap off and it made my Wife's showers take forever to get her hair washed. I think I'm going to start bringing a shower head and a wrench when I travel. I live in California so our shower heads are already limited. But the hotels go too far. The bathroom towels felt like sand paper, where VERY scratchy, and very small. We ended up just using our beach towels that we had brought.
__label__positive	People at front desk were very nice.
__label__very_negative	Dirty hotel, poor towels conditions
__label__neutral	The hotel was okay. I made reservations for a room with 2 queen size beds, and we got a king with a pull out bed. I was not happy with that obviously. Then when we got there we were excited to use the pool. Which on the website showed that it had a slide. We were disappointed when we realized that, not only did it not have a slide, but the pool looked cloudy and dirty. The hot tubs outside were relaxing but the area needs a little TLC. Other than that, the continental breakfast was nice, and the rooms were clean. Not sure if I would recommend this hotel or not.
__label__negative	This Hampton was not as clean and updated as the Hampton Hotels I am used to. The room was a bit run down. When I first entered the room I killed a tiny bug on the bathroom counter.

__label__positive	Den Aufenthalt vom 3. bis 8.5.2015 haben wir sehr genossen. Die Atmosphre im Hotel war sehr angenehm. Leider haben wir erst zu spt erfahren, dass es mglich gewesen wre, sowohl einen Khlschrank als auch einen Heiwasserbereiter zu bekommen, denn das waren die Dinge, die wir in einem Doppelzimmer de Luxe vermisst haben. Unser Zimmer war wie gewnscht mit einem Aufzug erreichbar und hatte auch einen Balkon. Sollten wir wieder einen Aufenthalt in diesem Hotel planen, wrden wir, abhngig von der Jahreszeit, ein Zimmer Richtung Osten nehmen, da keine Klimaanlage vorhanden ist und es bei heiem Wetter in Sd- oder Westlage doch recht warm im Zimmer werden knnte.
__label__positive	Check in was bad. Staff was rude like they wasn't expecting a guest late when I called and confirmed earlier that day. Empty water bottle found in room under a chair while just placing my bag down. I found the same kinda water in the fridge. It was an 8 pack with only one full one left in it. I have no idea if it was supplied by the hotel or not. We threw it out. The toilet made a high pitched noise that would only stop it after you flushed it again. The Kleenex tissue had only 1 tissue and was never replaced at all. The morning we left when we stopped by the continental breakfast the same employee that checked me in was there. She acknowledged 1/10 people in the room. I even said good morning to no reply. It was a convenient location for our trip to Becker College for our son. We had a 2 day orientation and would have had a more pleasant stay here if things like this were actually addressed. I know it's hard work and not appreciated by many. But as for someone that works in customer service every day myself I was amazed by the lack of interaction between hotel staff and guests. These things reflect upon upper management. Maybe some team building exercises to make their job not just a job but a fun and good safe place to work as well. If I was to stay here again it would be simply because of location...:)
__label__very_positive	This hotel has a great staff, great facilities to include a good continental breakfast (way better than most you will find at like hotel chains).

__label__negative	A short 2 nights stay for us a married couple that live on Fuerteventura. The bathroom was not very clean, when you take a bath and can see UNDERNEATH the hand rails on the side of the bath you can tell. There was sand on the floor even though we never went to the beach. The bed was very hard for my comfort but I know some people prefer a hard bed. Breakfast was buffet style and not very appetising. There is a commercial centre next door and there was a very nice English restaurant that we would highly recommend. ' The Sea View' . This part of Fuerteventura is much more expensive than Corralejo. The hotel is about a 20 mins walk from the town but right opposite McDonalds, don't bother the meat is different here. The hotel is right on the flight path but the double glazing is good so did not bother us. The airport closes about 11.30 but the last flights arrive and depart much sooner. I think the airport opens about 7 or 8 am. Overall it was overpriced, not good value for money. Most guests were all inclusive, were not offered this option or would we have taken it anyway. The beer, wine and spirits are very poor quality. OK for young families I suppose.

I asked that it just be cleaned returned to our room at 10:30P to find an attempt to clean was done but not very well. Still hair in the shower curtain that ended up in the tub and the hair on the floor was never cleaned up. Also in the toilet was someone's leftover movement that wasn't cleaned properly as well. The old style elevator was kind of scary as it had us stuck between floors after another person waiting on it kept pushing buttons.

But as I booked end prepaid through hotels dot com app, I had no way out other than to forfeit my money.. so we stayed on the springy cheap mattress in the dirty room with mold in the bathroom and God the list could go on.. this place isn't worth 29 a night let alone the hundred twenty nine we got robbed for.

__label__very_negative	It was so hot we could not stand to be in the condo. The shower in the master bath did not work, and there was not enough hot water to fill the tub. Very disappointed in this rental! Will not stay here again!
__label__neutral	Good Location
__label__negative	We were disappointed to find out they didn't separate the pet friendly rooms from non. I do not want to stay in a room where someone else's pet has stayed.
__label__very_negative	It was horrible the housekeeper was kept knocking on door after we asked her to clean the room after we left see goes to get manager he harassed us and threatened us cops were called it just was a mess rooms were smelly and hot i would not recommend this hotel to a dog
__label__very_positive	This hotel is extremely clean. My kids walked in our room without their socks on and did not see any dirt on their feet. Their sheets and comforter are cleaned and washed for the guest. I must say, this is one of the few hotels i have been comfortable sleeping in. And the shower/tub is clean as well!!

__label__very_positive	This place seemed like the Brand's Flagship location
__label__positive	Water hard. Had to put a towel in tub because stopper was broken. For the rate this was a pretty good rom
__label__neutral	This is a nice, clean hotel. The staff member at check-in was a snob. I am a rewards member but felt like it wasn't good enough for her that I was only the first level member. However, the staff the next day was much better. Breakfast is worth skipping.
__label__very_positive	Great location, dining, entertainment and shopping
__label__positive	Was in Springfield for the Antique Extravaganza, so had booked room several months in advance. Location was great for us, overall fine stay. We had to get a Jacuzzi room because nothing else was available. I would not recommend unless the tub really means something to you. In that floor plan, the bathroom is quite small.
__label__positive	Wes pleasantly surprised by the great experience I had. All staff was very friendly. Facilities were well maintained and modern and the food was good. Bed was MUY comfortable. Only complaint was room AC did not get as cold as I would have liked.
__label__very_positive	I spent 5 nights at Vista Hotel. I was on the 3rd floor in room 336. It was a nice room, spacious and clean. Lily did a wonderful job keeping my room tidy and left adorable towel animals in my room and bathroom. The continental breakfast was sufficient for my needs. The entire staff was friendly and helpful. If I am in this area again I will stay at Vista Hotel again.
__label__positive	Safety caution
__label__positive	I asked for a nonsmoking room and was pleased with the fact that it didn't seem like other people were smoking, so that's good. You get a 7 breakfast credit for the restaurant which was cool, although I think I prefer traditional continental breakfasts that are buffet style. The wifi was fast, so that was good. I didn't use the pool/hot tub/gym BUT it looked clean and ready to use. The staff was very friendly and helpful.
__label__very_positive	Needs to catch up.

__label__positive	Comfortable, spacious, clean rooms. Great location for activities with U. of O. student. Easy access to river bike and walk paths.
__label__very_positive	The motel is well maintained, clean, and offers a lot of amenities. My stay was a free reward night so I can't speak regarding the room rates and value. The location is convenient to I-25 and Hwy 50 west.
__label__positive	They only have 1 infant crib (we have twins, which made it tricky) so reserve it in advance!
__label__positive	Convenient location close to the highway and lots of shopping/restaurants. Good for travelers. Free breakfast was a little sparse compared to other places I have stayed, mostly cold cereal, fruit and bagels, but it was sufficient. Hotel was cleaned and well-maintained, as was the pool. The pool is a little small, but it was clean and heated to a nice temperature. Staff were pleasant.
__label__very_negative	Not what we expected.
__label__very_negative	The hotel is very rough looking outside and in. The hotel appears to be in the middle of renovation and it shows. The room was was descent on the inside, but the hallways and elevator and everywhere else were in poor shape. The swimming pool was on the small size but clean. The continental breakfast was good. I wouldn't stay at the hotel again while in this shape, maybe I would try it again after complete but it's just a little to grunge for me.
__label__positive	NIce trip
__label__positive	Nice view of Seattle..
__label__very_negative	This was perhaps the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. The check in process was antiquated and took forever. Then they sprang the surprise: a 75 per room per night security deposit. We had 2 rooms and had booked 3 nights. Translation: we left the front desk 450 lighter than we arrived. The elevators were scary and the line to board the elevator was often 50 or more people. I ended up taking the stairs (to the 7th floor) several times to avoid the line for the elevators. The staff were lackluster at best, often sullen and dismissive. The casino was dull and dated. There were lots of other nasty surprises too numerous to list here. The ONLY redeeming quality was Guy Fieri's restaurant, El Burro Borracho (Spanish for the drunken donkey). We spent most of our time in Laughlin at other casinos and had a great time there. We were drawn in by the low price but after adding in the almost 12 nightly resort fee and the stifling security deposit, it was no bargain. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place!

__label__positive	Good brief Stay. Breakfast needed help. We really like the LaQuinta Motel in Macon, GA (I475) breakfast. The warm eggs were barely editable. Room and other features were AOK. Nearby restaurants were great, particularly the Longhorn where your staff provided a coupon for a free apatizer.

__label__neutral	The hotel was nice and looks recently renovated. The front desk staff, both of them, were not welcoming and did not acknowledge any guests unless first talked to. And then when the breakfast came out an hour and a half late, they didn't even take time to tell us even though they saw us pass their desk toward the breakfast area. After finally asking them by breakfast wasn't out 45 minutes after it should have, they told us the cook decided not to come in while saying sorry in the least apologetic tone I've ever heard. The staff that did try and make up the breakfast were very nice and I applaud them for their efforts to make up what was missed. Overall the hotel itself was nice, the rooms were nice, except our bathroom did not have an exhaust fan.
__label__very_positive	Erittin viihtyis hotelli lyhyen matkan pss keskustasta. Bussiterminaaliin matkaa n. 400-500m. Huone (Double deluxe) oli tilava ja merinkym huoneesta oli aivan mahtava. Hintaan kuulunut aamupala oli todella runsas ja tuotti vlill jopa valinnan vaikeutta. Hotellin henkilkunta oli ystvllist ja palvelualtista.

__label__negative	This hotel is fine. Room was clean and staff was nice and helpful, but the TV remote didn't work properly, one light switch didn't work and the security was abysmal (door outside had no lock). Cheap but you can see why. Room did have deadbolt which made it ok.
__label__negative	Weak exoerience. Started with reservation issues. Front desk essentially trashed online, third-party booking. Disagreed on room chisen. Asked for a kjng over two doubles. But it costs more, says front desk rep. Eventually, I oaybyhe 2 upcharge. Indoor hotel with two floors but no elevator, bummer. WiFi did not work. Given an alternative. Still did not work.

__label__neutral	Hotel is clean, updated. Stopped at this hotel after a competition, wanted to relax in the apparent large pool. Pictures are misleading. However pool was nice. My disparity is that room info book states pool open 7 am to 12(midnight), got to pool at 10:40 pm, only to be asked to leave immediately. Pool room poster states pool open 8 am to 11pm. Hotel personnel knows of disparity, but that's the way it is. Breakfast was good. Ended up swimming in morning. Minor, but a little annoying.
__label__very_positive	I am very particular about where I lay my head at night. After visiting several hotels in the griffin area during my business trips, this is my favorite. It is very clean, the staff is professional, and the rooms are okay. I wanted to switch rooms with a bigger work desk and the manner and ease in which they handled things was awesome! The breakfast is also wonderful!

__label__negative	Overpriced for the quality and location. It was Labor Day weekend so I expected to pay more but, paying over 300/night for a room that was worth a third of that was hard to swallow. If the price was right during a normal weekend, I'd consider staying there again. Rooms need an upgrade.
__label__very_positive	Perfect
__label__neutral	After driving for hours our family decided to find a cheap room to get some sleep. We were pleasantly surprised by the size and condition of the room. To be fair you get what you pay for, proven by the faint odor of cigarette smoke and outdated color scheme. However, I'm one of those OCD moms that carries Lysol wipes in my purse and after wiping everything down we realized that the room had been cleaned well, outside of the residual cigarette smell. I would recommend that management take the time to replace filters and deep clean vents and carpets to allow for another star to be added. If we have the need to stay in Big Rapids again we would consider Quality Inn.
__label__neutral	Close to Boise State University
__label__neutral	The breakfast was disgusting. Before I ate, I cleaned up for 10 minutes. The 1 trash can was overflowing, nobody had stocked in quite awhile, we ate cereal with forks (there were no spoons). It was creepy to use a community milk and cream cheese instead of the normal small hotel containers we're used to. The front desk attendant acted like a zombie (no emotion, not friendly or rude). I called a couple of days later to ask if they found a cell phone in the room. I was finally a little impressed that they said they'd call back very soon. Guess what They didn't call back!! To end on a positive note, the room was comfortable and the location of the hotel was in a cute town and super close to Michigan's Adventure.

__label__very_negative	When we arrived pool was closed Due to an ACCIDENT , that makes me wonder-- we never used the pool after that. The brochurers for Sept. had already been thrown away and Oct- Dec. in its place. So we had no idea what there was to do in this town. I couldn't get connected to Internet wirelessly nor through cable. So I couldn't look things up and I could not send my work via internet at all during my stay. The breakfast in the restaurant was about the worst I have ever had, and the price made it even harder to swallow. JUST GROSS- we had the buffet. We chose Bay City only because my husband wanted to book a NICE HOTEL which now seems like a huge mistake. I have traveled all around the US and stay in various hotels. This was very clean, but other than that it was a huge waste of our money. For the price of these rooms I expected a great deal more. A balcony for sure when your paying for a river view. We found the HIDDEN microwave and mini fridge on the DAY WE WERE LEAVING, that would have been nice to use during our stay. JUST A WASTE of money.
__label__very_positive	Lovely hotel

__label__very_positive	My Stay on Dec. 12-13, 2015
__label__neutral	Overall the trip was good,my only complaints were that the chain was not securely attached to the door frame, also I would have liked if the hotel was all together or that there were vending machines in the back building. It was a little inconvenient to have to trek across the parking lot in the cold to get something out of the machines or to get breakfast. But otherwise it was great.
__label__very_negative	AT&T phone service doesn't work in the rooms here and he wireless is rather slow. Completely ridiculous that I'm unable to use my phone in my room.

__label__very_positive	Great Florence hotel
__label__very_negative	I was on the property for 10 minutes max. Exhausted after driving 10 hours, my son and I had made a reservation here. Failed to mention there was a bar attached to the hotel, in one of the sketchiest hidden places around. We opened the hotel door, my son screamed because he was scared and it smelled moldy, we left. Do not bring your kids/yourself here!
__label__very_positive	Just walk onto the grounds and you know this is something superior. The service is impeccable. The food is wonderful. The rooms are more than comfortable. And the grounds are Edenic. You just feel like you have entered something special. It may be the best place I have ever stayed.

__label__very_positive	AWSOME SERVICE BY SHERRY E
__label__neutral	Inconsistency can best sum up many of the Concentrics properties and The Lobby is no exception. Some stuff was good, other stuff very mediocre, and some stuff bad.The goat cheese appetizer was delicious! The fingerling potatoes stuffed with crab and bacon were just so so. The wood grill pizza, not so great. I got the cheese with gorgonzola, arugula, etc.The service was nice but not exceptional. The restaurant is too loud and without much of a defining ambience. It's definitely a lobby restaurant but not in a good way.I would not recommend going out of your way to go there. But, if you are staying at the hotel as we are, it's nice because it's convenient.
__label__neutral	It wasn't so bad, but that was just my room. I mean it looked old and the facilities were meh. But I slept comfortably and didn't sweat. I guess it should be priced $30, though. Every time I went into the lobby, someone was complaining about something (one couple said their pillows had no casings (lol, good lord)). But I was expecting the worst, the ladies at the lobby were nice to me, and the location was a short drive from St. Mary's.

__label__positive	Had a room on the second floor and the hotel had no elevator. We are senior citizens so carrying our luggage up two flights of stairs is difficult. Why no elevator
__label__neutral	Ugh. Our room was filthy, staff were uninformed and ignored us, the only thing that recommends this hotel is it's proximity to Starbuck's and Oconomowoc Lake - if that's one's destination. Blahblah blah e07598598w798ew798w7984798r7
__label__very_positive	Great service, great cookies, breakfast typical, Complintary internet work well, Just need a Jacuzzi in the pool area. The hallway on the 3rd floor smelled a little Smokey, but the room was fine no smoke smell at all.

__label__very_positive	For more than 50 years, this hotel's familiar green sign has signaled budget-friendly lodging for families and business travelers. In ShortSince its 1952 debut in Memphis, Tenn., Holiday Inn has become one of the most recognized hotel brands in the world.

__label__negative	Usually love this hotel but front desk super rude this time
__label__very_positive	We stayed here to attend a convention in the National harbour. Our room was a little dusty in a few spots but otherwise everything appeared clean. The people at the front desk were especially polite and courteous. If we stay in the area again this will likely be our first choice.
__label__neutral	Check out Procedure Ungodly Slow
__label__negative	Stayed for three nights.  Wouldn't recommend it for more than overnight.
__label__neutral	Breakfast was awful
__label__neutral	Great location
__label__very_negative	I usually stay in about 20 to 30 different hotels a year and this place was by far the worst. The room was very dirty with spiderwebs, obvious stains on the chairs, items (dirty towels) left from the previous guests and the bed was a little scary to sleep in (we ended up sleeping in our sleeping sacks) . The doors to the building don't lock and the furniture of the rooms urgently needs replacement: TV from the 80s, toilet having issues flushing, the curtain kept falling of the track, the window lock would not close securely the windows were dirty and lights did not sufficiently illuminate the room. The worst thing however is the breakfast. Not only that the buffet is small and lacks fresh or healthy options the hotel personnel used their bare hands to refill food. In general the people working at the Guesthouse Inn miss a service-minded work attitude. Communication with guests is done while chewing gum and chatting with their relatives and the hotel employees have breakfast in the same room and at the same time as the guests and still fail to identify the need for refills. We felt safer and cleaner out camping and will definitely not stay at this place again.

__label__neutral	We got the deluxe king w/ whirlpool. It was dirty with hair and soap scum in the tub. The bar area wasn't that clean either. However, the room was large and bed was comfortable.

__label__very_positive	Great night...hope to return
__label__negative	This hotel is in much need of repair.
__label__very_positive	I have been making frequent stays at the Wingate LaGrange for the past 18 months. One word that captures the experience: consistency. Fresh clean rooms and exceptional customer service are consistent with every visit - and I actually look forward to staying there.
__label__very_negative	This hotel is a dump! Upon checking in was told that the place was booked with folks who are running from Isaac -- the folks are depressed, sad and crying -- we got a room with no problem as a matter of fact the parking lot and inside hotel were rather empty despite the fact that the place was booked -- the room reaked -- air conditioning unit blew out luke warm air despite having control turned to high cool -- linens and bath towels were rough and ...view morewell worn. The corridors reaked of curry/incense and it was obvious other air freshners were used to mask the obvious odors. Not opposed to other cultures but if you are going to have that sort of thing waifing through the hotel you should advertise such. My expectations are a clean room with no visible signs of anything else... would NOT recommend this place... BTW the free breakfast was nothing more than day old bakery goods with what was suppose to be biscuits and gravy... the folks running from Isaac would have been better off to weather the storm! Use this place only as a very last resort!view less

__label__very_negative	This was by far the worst hotel we have stayed at. I travel all over as a contractor hotel didnt have mattresses had to move rooms 4 times then the police did a drug raid same night not to mention the rooms were just disgusting and no heat checked out next morning and the hotel manager says that they will not refund my money and that it is not his fault.

__label__neutral	This was a good, basic hotel that provided a safe, clean place to sleep while I was visiting on business. The staff was very helpful, making sure that the room was heated before I checked in (which was very thoughtful, as it was a particularly cold week). If you're looking for a conveniently located, no-frills type of place, this is your place.
__label__neutral	Customer service is not a priority here. I asked for a bottle of water and they told me you have to pay for it, you are just a regular customer. I was offended. I understand I am not a rewards member but to be dismissed was shocking.
__label__very_positive	It was a quiet clean frienly enviroment and the sraff was very pleasant the pool was relaxing and the breakfast was great! I have no complaints and my suite was beautiful. Didn't want to leave!
__label__neutral	We have stayed at this hotel before, but were disappointed this time, mainly because the room had a very strong odor. I think they need to get rid of the carpeting. Didn't smell it in the hall, but as soon as you opened the door to the room, your were hit with it. They do have a good breakfast.

__label__very_positive	Just a romantic one night getaway and it was wonderful. We really enjoyed the heated out door infinity edge pool even in February and the room was gorgeous, spacious, and comfortable. Just a case truly getting what you pay for. Worth every penny. Just wish they hadn't given us a room so far from the spa with a partially obstructed view. Request something other than 219.
__label__negative	Great amenities! Nice condos, awesome pool
__label__negative	Not so happy
__label__negative	It was okay, but clearly the bathrooms and rooms need to be updated they are very old and worn. Great location and staff was very nice and helpful.

__label__very_positive	They are remodeling many of their rooms. Locks on sliding doors are tricky to lock. Pillows are not the most comfortable. Nice area. No shady characters noted. Would stay there again. Do not have a continental. Swimming pool was nice and large, nice bar area.
__label__very_positive	Hotel was convenient to I95 and well above average in appearance and appointments. Staff was very gracious and accommodating. We were passing through so one night stay. Did not eat in restaurant because alternatives were very close by. Rate was not a bargain but worth the price.
__label__positive	My pre wedding pic were taken here. My room was clean. Jennifer the front desk was awesome went above to give the accommodation for my tired family to check in early. Staff was awesome to cheer and congratulate me when i came down stairs. Keep up the great Friendly Welcome.
__label__positive	Dirty towels on the back of the bathroom door, otherwise the room was clean. No remote for television. Lady at check-in was rude when I wanted to pay cash instead of charging to the card that I had used to reserve the room. Breakfast: Terrible coffee. Unless you are an oatmeal person, the only real protein was sausage. No eggs or yogurt. Soggy french toast. Other choices were biscuits, plain gravy, dry cereal (milk), juice, apples, toast, cake donuts, bagels. CARB overload.
__label__very_negative	Room
__label__negative	The hotel was nice for an adult only type of vacation. However, most of the pools were closed during our stay due to weddings, the pools that were open had no towels available in the afternoon, and the hotel pool bars were closed by 4 PM each day. The food was mediocre at best. Overall it wasn't an upscale resort like I was hoping. The one redeeming quality was the views.
__label__very_positive	Garden of the Gods Club was the most beautiful venue we found in Colorado and my husband and I are so pleased we decided to marry there and have our reception for 120 people there in the main dining room. Although it was expensive, or more than most venues, it was worth every penny. The staff, especially Rosa Falu, their wedding coordinator, was incredible. Although it rained and we could not marry out on the lawn overlooking the beautiful rock formations, they have a gorgeous terrace that was still wonderful and romantic. There were deer on the lawn in the midst and the guests sipped hot chocolate in September. The food was delicious and the cake was the best anyone had ever tasted. The rooms were gorgeous and everyone was pleased and said we had the most beautiful wedding anyone had ever been to. I highly recommend Garden of the Gods Club!!! Everyone should be so lucky to get married there!

Rooms were somewhat better. Best thing was their delicious flatbreads and breakfast sandwiches. Quiet despite busy transit area.
__label__positive	The Abbey Resort has been in Fontana for many, many years.  It has been redone and is very acceptable now.  Before the remodel, it was very run down.  It's a great place in the winter as well as the summer.  The food is very good, too.

__label__neutral	No choice of other hotels in the area as it was a busy weekend for students visiting colleges. The other hotels in the area didn't appear much better from the outside. This was within our budget and close to the colleges. It was okay. Rooms were clean and staff was pleasant and helpful. The T.V. only had about four channels and the water in the shower was barely warm. The outside looked fairly nice except they had two pedestals , one at each doorway, to put cigarettes out in and they clearly had not been emptied in quite a long time. Even as a long time smoker, this was quite unpleasant and smelly. I like that the cigarette disposals were available when I went outside for an occasional cigarette, however, the fact that they were not emptied in a while and the fact that they were swimming in rain water from earlier in the day, was off putting even to me. Next time I go to Ithaca, I may have to stay there again if there are no other hotels within my budget. Do I think it was worth the money No! I think they have a lot of nerve charging those rates for that kind of hotel, but like all the other parents visiting colleges that particular weekend, we didn't have much choice.

__label__positive	Good value and nice culture
__label__very_positive	Hotel employees very helpful in giving directions on the best places to visit and see in Venice. You are able to by a bus pass at the hotel to get to the island since you are on the mainland. Bus stop is directly outside the door to the hotel. Close to a piazza where you could stop for supper and have drinks later at night. The beds were uncomfortable but the room was spacious with its own bathroom. This hotel doesn't have an elevator which is inconvient for people with mobility issues.
__label__very_positive	They have done a lot of remodeling. It is great! Nice staff.
__label__very_positive	Very funky little hotel... the only thing(s) I'd change would be to have a small coffee maker in the room and maybe a complimentary bottle of water because the tap water tastes terrible and there is no mini-bar. Otherwise great, we plan on returning very soon.

__label__negative	For the price, which admittedly is in a resort-like area, I expect more. Many small items in our room were broken (hooks, window treatment, etc.). The desk clerk was very nice. The breakfast was so-so. Basically the place needs some TLC.

__label__positive	This is a nice generic place to stay. The complimentary breakfast is minimal, but that's not why we chose this place. Minor point: although the scent of cleaning product wasn't as strong as other places I've been in, I wish this place and others would either lighten up on the amount or get an unscented kind.

If you aren't into walking the free shuttle runs on King Street and is very easy to access. They have free pick up at the airport and also for your return. No in room coffee which I missed but coffee and teas available in the lobby every morning which was nice and a wine reception in the afternoon.

__label__very_positive	This is a beautiful and classy old school hotel. It is located in a great neighborhood and close to shopping and the train station. Not everything works as you expect it to (water needed about five turns of the tap to turn on, for example) but everything does work and is in great condition. The staff is friendly and knowledgable. Well worth the money. Breakfast is also top notch and included.

__label__very_positive	Coming back to Long Island from Montreal, I wanted to break up the drive and stay somewhere overnight in between. This hotel had the best rating/price ratio. The room is spacious, I only saw about three other guests during my stay (quiet), and it is in a great location to malls, food, etc. Considering the full kitchen, I can see this being a good several day stay for anyone that needed to be in Albany for a while.

__label__very_negative	I pulled in at 1 am with two small children just wanting a bed to sleep in. This hotel was so gross, roach infested, dark,and quite scary. The hotel clerk knew the hotel was bad and asked me to view the rooms before I decided to stay. I viewed two rooms. And both looked horrific. Needless to say we did not stay at this hotel and I had to search for another one in the middle of the night. And I was not the only customer in there at that time viewing rooms and deciding not to stay. Do not stay at this hotel. It needs to be condemned!!

__label__very_negative	Not a pleasant stay at all - when I checked in I was not told I was being giving and ADA room, and didn't get to the room until after meetings and dinner - it was about 11:30 and I was settled in when I realized there was not an actual shower. I called the front desk and was told - well what would you like me to do. Changing rooms was apparently not an option. I finally attempted to use the shower and the drain didn't work and water flooded all over the bathroom. I then used the incredibly tattered towels to attempt to mop up the bathroom. Someone should have informed me that I was being giving and ADA room...and then imagine if you were in a wheelchair and had to use a flooding bathroom! Disgusting and disappointing. Will never stay there again.

J'ajoute que le restaurant est dlicieux et d'un excellent rapport qualit/prix.
__label__neutral	I specifically requested a room for 5 adults, I was given a room that was nothing like the room I reviewed on line, except for the two queen beds. We didn't have enough room to unfold the folding bed, the hotel manager on duty did nothing to try and accommodate us, except to agree that the on line photos needed to be updated. This was our first time at Hampton inn and our last time. Hampton Inn did serve a good breakfast and the other hotel workers were courteous and customer friendly.

__label__positive	Good Service in Dahlonega
__label__positive	Perfect for a one night stay to go daughter play volleyball.
__label__very_positive	disappointing
__label__negative	Check in is too late and check out is too early. You pay over 200 for a sub-standard room and check in is at 4:00pm (I tried checking in an hour early but they wouldn't let me), and check out is at 10:00am. If we go back up to the same part of Park City, we will stay somewhere else. The hotel itself was very basic...not worth over 200/night. I expect better things from Marriott. Look elsewhere!
__label__very_positive	Very good
__label__very_negative	The hotel was disgusting. The carpet was stained and the paint on the walls did not match. It smelled terrible and was musty and moldy.
__label__positive	Lobby has quickly become one of my favorite spots to visit with my girl friends. Service is always impeccable, no matter where you are seated in the restaurant. The atmosphere is modern, sleek, and energetic. This place is great whether you are dining with a big group or with a date. I've tried many of the dishes here, but my favorites are (for appetizers) the tuna crudo, the PEI mussels, and the fried clams. The pizzas are OK -- nothing incredibly special, but still good. Try the pine nut pesto or the italian sausage, and you can never go wrong with the margherita pizza. The entrees here are good, but they may have changed the menu since I last went. I loved the salmon and they used to have an amazing steamed halibut dish that was to die for. Desserts and drinks are delicious here too - extensive, impressive wine list, fantastic, gorgeous cocktails (I recommend the pomegranate mojito). All in all, this is a great place to try -- I would recommend some of the other Concentrics restaurants before this one (like One Midtown Kitchen, Two Urban Licks, Murphy's, Trois), but if you're in the Atlantic Station area, it's worth a visit.
__label__positive	Nice place to rest

__label__negative	Definitely not super fancy (a lot of stuff is falling apart), but it's nice enough for an extended stay and the staff are very nice. Breakfast is granola bars, muffins and yogurt.
__label__very_positive	Great place to stay
__label__positive	Check-in was great, and although we arrived early we were upgraded to a ready suite. Great first impression! Breakfast was very nice, with both the standard Holiday Inn Express fare and some nice additional surprises that provided a home-cooked quality. Staff members (sometimes as many as five or six) too often congregate to smoke on a bench located in the hotel's front driveway, adjacent to the front door. This does not provide a good first (or second or third) impression to guests, and the hotel management should definitely find a more secluded place for the ladies to smoke.
__label__very_positive	I'm from the city and found it to be comfortable and quiet-- my friend is from the country and was bothered by the lights from the outside and the late-night chatter of guests next door.

Was very friendly, helpful, cheerful, represented the hotel very well. The room were clean and breakfast was okay. The location was convenient . For the price compared to other surrounding hotels, well worth it.
__label__very_positive	Fantastic stay. Great/.safe area with lots of restaurants and antique shops (if you're into that sort of thing)... hotel is a 15 min walk from the metro. Staff are very helpful and the restaurant next door a good choice for breakfast. There are adequate gym facitlities for a hotel and a decent pool. Staff are able to give you good and easy to follow routes for running. There isn't really anything bad to say about this hotel except that it is quite far away from Dulles. Worth the journey though and would definitely stay there again.

You could see the sale of drugs inside the hotel. They charged me $93.38 and refunded me $46.59 after 15 minutes that I checked in. They said they have to charge me because I already checked in. Left and whent to Howard Johnson hotel, problem solved. This Crack house is giving bad reputetion to Expedia. The San Antonio police department and health department should take care of this problem.Nothing
__label__positive	Authentic style hotel with great service
__label__neutral	OK for short stay.
__label__very_positive	Very nice
__label__negative	The hotel and our room smelled a little off, we had to buy an air freshener to make it smell better. There was a broken lamp in our room and we had to ask for more pillows for our king bed when we got there. The hotel is under construction but all the work being done didn't look like it would help much. The pool needed to be cleaned and the key card slot to get into the pool area was broken. The continental breakfast wasn't great but that's what you get when it's free.
__label__positive	We had a single king size bedroom.  It was quite large with many places to sit as well as a large bathroom.  Everything was in good shape considering the age of the hotel.  The bed was very comfortable as my back was aching when I got to the room from the drive.  The hotel has a restaurant inside.  Prices were typical of a fancier place $12 for sandwich with side $15-25 for an entry.  I went to get food shortly after I arrived at the hotel and found a 10% off coupon for the restaurant and two free drink coupons on top of the two free breakfast coupons which we used the next day.  My wife and I slept well for the first time in a long time as we didn't have the kids with us.  Breakfast in the morning was different.  They only open up half of the restaurant and you had to wait to be seated.  Our wait was about 15 minutes, a couple with their two kids must have waited nearly 25-30 minutes to get a seat.  And this was for a buffet style breakfast.  I am use to a more sit yourself and help yourself approach.  Maybe this way they can take special orders for guests that don't want the normal buffet.  It seemed a little backwards as breakfast ended at 10:30 AM checkout was at 11:00 AM so if you didn't know you were going to have to wait that long you might miss out.  Other than that we had a good time.  The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful.  I would definitely stay here again.

__label__positive	Generelt fremst hotellet som forholdsvis nyrenoveret, der er pnt og rent. Morgenmad er som alle andre steder i USA, lidt kedeligt og ensformigt, og det er meget trangt i spiseomrdet. Vi brugt hotellet til en enkelt overnatning inden hjemturen, og det er fint central i forhold til bde strand og lufthavn. Der er et meget lille poolomrde p 2. sal men det er fint til lige at slappe af et par timer. Hotellet havde skiftet navn/ejer og vi blev lidt overrasket over at skulle betale for parkering, men den fik vi os snakket ud af, da det fremgik af vores reservation at parkering var incl.

They used the pool area for two days and a room just down the hall from mine. Noise and working all night. Then the night they left, the fire alarm went off at 2AM. No fire, just pranksters and the alarm staying on for thirty minutes. I didn't enjoy my stay at all and the hallway carpet seemed damp and smelled. There are too many other great hotels in this area to go here again.

We got a free ride on their chair lift up the mountain and hiked down. We saw a number of interesting shops and restaurants in the Big Sky valley. The next day we went to Yellowstone about 1 hour to the West Gate, and another 15 or so minutes to the first geyser area.
__label__very_negative	The carpets were soaked and smelled like a mold. Maybe the a.c. was leaking. Not sure but bathroom was dirty and run down. I wouldn't be dissappointed if the room was 50 bucks per night. I made last minute reservations and the room was 155 dollars for the night. The most expensive super 8 motel I've ever heard of. It was a ghetto motel in a nice area
__label__negative	If you ONLY want a room for ONE NIGHT, and fly out, then this is a good place. No Frills, nothing exciting to write home about. A queen bed and bath and TV. Now, the shuttle service to/from Jax Airport was very good and very prompt in getting us to the airport and picking us up and taking us back.
__label__very_positive	We really enjoyed the Rose room. The breakfasts were awesome, Bill and Beverly were great. It was a great getaway and one we'll do again. Why stay in a hotel when you can have this wonderful experience. We'll do it again for sure! Ron and Sue

__label__very_negative	The hotel was not clean. My desk chair had a giant unidentifiable stain on its seat and I did not want to take my shoes off in the room. There were also ants crawling on the desk and I was on the top floor. The beds and bedding were very subpar as well.

__label__very_positive	This hotel was amazing !!!! I have never slept on a bed this comfortable. The room was very clean and spacious. I wish there were more hotels around like this.
__label__very_positive	different motel 8
__label__negative	This hotel stay was one of two hotel stays on a long road trip. We used a hotels.com giftcard so the stay was free for us. Because the stay was free I don't have many complaints because the room served the purpose of providing beds to sleep in and free breakfast in the morning.
__label__very_positive	We had a nice relaxing stay. The staff was extremely nice and professional. We will stay again.
__label__very_positive	Hotel was comfortable and rooms were soundproof. They do allow pets but seemed to confine them to the first floor. Breakfast was substantial. General hotel cleanliness left a bit to be desired -- floors and hallways outside of rooms were not swept for the 4 days of our stay (we saw the same crumbs and wrapper on the stairwell each day). Room was clean and made up promptly.
__label__very_negative	Do not stay at this hotel - it's disgusting in every sense! Nasty and dirty, nothing works, no toilet paper, two towels, awful awful awful. I am not kidding, after 57 years of life, this is the most disgusting hotel I've ever been in. Never never never will I even think of this hotel again without nightmares. Save your money and sleep in your car!

__label__positive	MO Jakarta is a good hotel, but comparing to Grand Hyatt, a same excellent hotel, MOJ's location is not that great, need to walk long way around the fountain to get into the Plaza Indonesia shopping mall.The executive lounge is better on food comparing to Grand Hyatt, but when you have visitors, it charges, that is certainly usual but not as generous as Grand Hyatt.That is why most of high end business visitors still stay at Grand Hyatt even though the room in MOJ is obviously better.
__label__negative	get a parking spot early
__label__very_negative	My daughter was moving into Mizzou so we went up the night before I made the reservations online I must say when I walked into the lobby of the hotel seem older but nice I then checked into my room went and got something to eat came back use the restroom to see two tiny bugs not sure what they were at this point I killed them and wanted to my room saw a roach crawling up my drink when I called the front desk I told the guy I have bugs in my room he said yes as if this were a regular occurrence and then took him about 15 minutes to get me moved to a different room to say the least I was absolutely mortified this hotel is disgusting
__label__neutral	"Door to outside of hotel had broken locks with a sign that said ""lock broken, push to open"" posted on it. Tub faucet leaked profusely. Room was clean and staff was very helpful and friendly."
__label__very_positive	Charles Bonner is a HERO!
__label__neutral	The only thing that was a problem was that there was no refrigerator or microwave in it like it said when I booked it, and when I got there the price was different than the amount I reserved with my credit card. The attitude at the front desk could have been warmer,but the room was nice and clean
__label__negative	The sheets would not stay on the bed....The mattress was very uncomfortable...Everything on the bed was old and cheap....When I say cheap...I mean prison cheap...The quality of the t.v was poor....The screen was dark and the channels were unclear...The continental breakfast was sorry....I paid for 2 nights but was ready to leave after the first night...If it was not for the game being in town and limited hotel availability...I would have left....The hotel is in bad need of updating...
__label__neutral	California was enough as is, I was seriously just happy to be there!! The vibes and food was amazing! I was not thinking much about the hotel, but to give it a rating it was alright place to lay your head at night!! Shower was really nice and the water felt amazing. It helped me sleep at night!
__label__very_negative	My stay at that place was horrible the bed had scum stains on it. I let the manager know and he showed me a receipt that they clean the sheets but, it was the comforter. They didn't have a coffee maker, neither did they have a iron and ironing board. The place was filthy the mirror wasn't clean the toilet has some stuff in it the hot tub supposedly was the big attraction and that was nasty too. The walls are paper thin.
__label__positive	The hotel was typical Hampton inn quality that I have become accustomed to. The one outstanding part of my stay was I forgot my prescription sunglasses in the room.

__label__very_positive	night shift staff is rude. was listed as a three star hotel on hotwire. definitely not a three star hotel.
__label__neutral	Very loud...bed not comfortable...TV not working
__label__negative	Found someone's dirty Kleenex and crumbs in our made bed. Told front desk and they put us in a new room. Hotel is in major need of updating and lacks some basic hotel amenities like clocks in the rooms, an ice machine, and low on towels. Continental breakfast was good. Hotel is in good location to nearby attractions.
__label__negative	good time
__label__positive	For the price the hotel was above and beyond expections. Great location, comfy beds all you could want when you are just needing a place to crash. Just a heads up if you are not facing the pool, you may want to bring a small fan if you are a light sleeper as the location is convient to everything, it does have the travel noise as well.
__label__positive	Work
__label__positive	Hotel was under construction. Was great. No refrigerator or microwave in our room. I don't know if that was due to the construction but it was odd. Rooms appeared clean showers weren't the best but they are remodeling the hotel so hopefully next time they will be sparkling!
__label__very_negative	Sent me an occupied room and then the room I finally got was marginal at best. Open bar of soap in the shower. I've stayed in many an inexpensive hotel so I am not prudish by any stretch of the imagination and this was the worst hotel I've stayed in. Avoid this place if you can!
__label__positive	The hotel looks as if the owner has given up... The room was clean with the exception of ONE dirty towel in the bathroom. The Hotel itself was hot and the tiles were cracked and looked dirty... half the hotel is under renovation right now but not sure if its being renovated or just shut off... The hotel front desk is extremely nice and helpful to any needs or concerns, my one complaint on thier side would be the lack of knowledge of surrounding resturants and attractions. The Breakfast consisted of Brown food... Coffee, bread, creals (bran, frosted flakes, and maybe rasin bran) and waffles... The Stay was OK and because we only used the room to sleep we didn't have to many issues... One more thing you can tell the hotel is on an old water system bc when ANYONE flushes or uses water the shower goes hot and cold...
__label__negative	Reserved through hotels.com late in the evening we'd be arriving - it was a last leg on a road trip so we didn't arrive until around 2 AM. The staff didn't seem to be aware of the booking and were rather unpleasant about looking it up. The room was fine we were excited about having breakfast in the hotel in the morning - except we found it to be a couple of muffins and plain instant oatmeal. We didn't stay after the breakfast room was visited by one of the staffer's yippee dog and a lovely cockroach we left immediately. Not recommended.
__label__neutral	I booked the hotel in Feb. when I arrived the hotel was under construction, I wish they would have sent me an email in advance saying it would be under construction. I also believe people actually lived in the hotel rooms. My air conditioner was all rusted and falling apart but still worked. Wasn't the room I expected either lots of people were saying they didn't get the room they thought they booked. It's not a bad hotel if you just plan on sleeping there and spending your days out.
__label__very_positive	It was a very friendly place to stay close to the resturants and shopping. Not far of the intersate if you are traveling through. There was a dog walking park right behind it.
__label__positive	Overall a good experience

__label__very_positive	Our wedding will be in August of 2016 and we are trying to plan about 8 months in advance. The service and responsiveness of the employees here was unbelievable. I received emails and calls within 30 minutes of my own, scheduled a tour, and received top notch service. The venue is beautiful and they allow you to make it your own. They encourage you to select vendors that you like are are comfortable with price-wise. They also guarantee the cost within around $100 of the total. Absolutely wonderful experience so far, and I'm excited to continue to work with them!
__label__very_positive	Very nice place! The flooring in our room was just replaced 2 weeks ago. Everything was very clean. The only problem that I had was the top of the mattress being so high.

__label__very_positive	If you are going to stay in quaint Old Town Alexandria, this is the place to stay. They have pet friendly rooms, a morning coffee station in the lobby and wine in the evening. The rooms were immaculate and tastefully decorated.If you are not used to city noises, be sure to request a room that is not on the King street side of the building- a trolley pulls up making electronic announcements of the stops all day/evening long. I was on the third floor and could even hear street conversations as people entered and exited the hotel.The pool and fitness room are nice too. Be sure to make your requests early- I think this hotel is often fully booked. There is another (?smaller) Kimpton hotel around the corner called the Morrison House. It was my first stay in a Kimpton hotel and it was very pleasant.

__label__very_negative	This place was miserable. It took over 20 minutes to check in. There was only one towel in the room and its cleanliness was questionable. Upon requesting additional towels, we were promised more towels, but they never made it. Every horizontal surface had cigarette burns on it. There was no chair to sit on to work at the desk. The room smelled bad. There was no shower head. The security lock on the door was broken. We will pitch a tent on the side of the highway before we stay here again.
__label__very_positive	The custom service is what makes this hotel a 5 in my book. Every single employee was professional and friendly. Every employee greeted me and smiled. The hotel is a bit dated but most important to me is the customer service and that it is clean and both of these were excellent. The price was not bad neither. I definitely... More
__label__very_positive	Liked the convenience of Fremont Street. Did not like the access to the parking garage, when staying in the North Tower. Liked the convenience of all the restaurants. Didn't like that the pool was only open until 7pm. The hotel staff was friendly. Didn't like having to pay the resort fees in addition to the room price. It should be included in the negotiated rate. The beds were very comfortable. The A/C worked awesome, since it was so hot.....108 in the day/ 98 in the night. Maintenance came quickly for a clogged toilet. Overall it was great, we had fun not worrying about the small stuff.

__label__negative	For the price the room could have been cleaner. The room also looked like a 12 year old painted it. The shower burnt both of us because the water was so hot and there was only three temps hot, warm and cold.
__label__very_negative	they are in the middle of renovating but appear to be charging prices that are more suitable for after the renovations are complete. first room the cable didn't work and there was quite a bit of water damage on the cabinets in the bathroom. the second room was better but the tv had an odd coloring to it. bed was comfortable however the pillows were tiny and flat which they made up for by providing a mass amount of pillows. i was almost completely disatisfied with the room. i will say the staff was very courteous and polite.

__label__very_negative	This place is a dump. It is old and dirty. The grounds were full of weeds that were not mowed. We would not have stayed here had we seen it in person before we booked.
__label__positive	Requested bed not guaranteed. I purchased King size bed through booking.com. When I got to the hotel after a long tiring day, they only had two double beds. They said it was because too many people had extended their stay. I said that they should have made those people move to a room with two double beds if they wanted to stay over. They didn't agree. They were nice about it and offered a complementary dinner from their restaurant in the lobby. I was super irritated. When we got to the room the AC wasn't on very high and it was so stuffy in the room that the crisp white linens on the two double beds were actually soft and wet to the touch. It took a while for the room to cool down and then the linens were still damp and a little smelly.

__label__neutral	Nous sommes alls dans cette htel car sur le descriptif de la chambre tait indiqu qu'il y avait un bain remous priv. En fait de bain remous c'tait une baignoire classique pas terrible du tout. Lorsque nous sommes arrivs nous avons eu une chambre avec 2 lits jumeaux , la chambre tait trs mal agence. Nous avons demand ds le lendemain changer de chambre et on nous a donn une chambre qui tait un peu mieux. Par contre les murs ne sont pas pais nous entendions tout ce que les voisins faisaient. Pas de double vitrage non plus et nous entendions les conversations dehors et les voitures passer. Le jaccuzzi sur le toit tait vide hors service. Les repas trs moyen et la salle de restaurant trs bruyante. En demi pension la bouteille de 50 cl d'eau cote 2,10 euros c'est un peu abuser pour une petite bouteille d'eau et on ne peut pas prendre de l'eau en carafe, si on ne prend pas de boisson ils nous retirent les verres. Cet htel ne vaut pas du tout les 4 toiles qu'il affiche. Par contre lorsqu'on sort de l'htel on se retrouve sur la promenade de la plage et c'est trs agrable.
__label__negative	When we entered the room, the smell of cleaning supplies was so strong that we almost passed out and immediately got a headache. The mirror was broken, wall paper peeling off of the wall, and the comforter was really wrinkled, like it had never been ironed or cleaned. A/C was not turned on by the front desk staff when we checked in, so after trying to get it to work for 10+ minutes, I returned to the front desk where the clerk informed me that he forgot to turn it on.

__label__very_positive	Nice staff, but housekeeping left a bit to be desired
__label__neutral	The Mountain Lodge has an outstanding appearance from the outside. It has a log cabin feel with excellent lighting. The outdoor pool and hot tub are also a plus in addition to the lounges that surround the pool area. The hotel staff were extremely helpful with showing us how to use the gondolas and where the various hiking trail heads were located they even gave us an outstanding map. The main drawbacks of the hotel are the small size of the room and the lack of sound deadening between rooms. At check-in, the person tried to upgrade us to a larger room (for 60 more a night) however, since we were already paying over 200 a night, we declined to upgrade. Anyway, the room we were in was next to a utility room with a loud hot water heater that cycled on and off all night. Also, the walls were so thin that we could hear the conversations of the people next to us. To top it off, there were two rooms near us with barking dogs one two doors down and one right across the hall. We found out later that they put the people with pets on the first floor therefore, I suggest that you request a room off of the first floor if you don't want to hear pet noises. All-in-all the stay was fine but the amount of noise in the room was unacceptable.

__label__neutral	great stay because of staff, especially Betty and Karla at the front desk. I did not appreciate paying for amentities like, swimming pool, beach access, wi fi which was very poor, and health spa. We did not or ever use these facilities so do not appreciate paying for them.

Hotellin aamupala oli runsas ja valikoimaa riitti. Hotellin lhistll on bussipyskki josta psee LA:n keskustaan.Hotellissa on pienehk uima-allas ja aurinkotuoleja. Ainoa pieni miinus huoneissa oli avainkortit, jotka nollaantuivat lhes pivittin, mutta ne sai respassa nopeasti eloon. Henkilkunta oli erittin ystvllist.
__label__very_positive	Wonderful Stay!
__label__negative	Room was fairly basic quality. It was clean enough, but there were corners and crannies that obviously have never seen a mop or vacuum. The bedding was very thin and the mattresses and pillows weren't very comfortable at all. It's a low frills room so I didn't expect to get blown away, but I did expect the fundamentals to be strong for the price. For other amenities, WiFi was artificially slowed so they can upsell on faster experience, so be aware. Utensils were available, but you have to ask, it would have been more welcoming to have them in the cabinets. Overall not a terrible experience, just kind of forgettable and didn't really make me feel I got a good value. Ultimately nearby competitors may offer more for the same price, or the same experience for less.

__label__neutral	These are not luxury accommodations but they have everything you need for longer stays. They are basically little condos with a small living room with fireplace, kitchenette small bath and a bedroom(s). I've stayed here on multiple occasions and found it quite comfortable. Some rooms are nicer and more updated than others, but all are cozy.
__label__very_positive	We enjoyed our stay here. Quiet, clean, and a place to park without paying exorbitantly. We highly recommend this hotel and plan on staying here again.
__label__very_positive	There were 14 of us on motorcycles for a weekend ride. Employees were all very friendly and helpful. They printed menu's from local restaurants that delivered, made sure breakfast items stayed full, and let us gather in the breakfast area during the evening to visit. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. Very nice stay.
__label__negative	The room was clean and nicely furnished. However, the room across from me had children screaming and doors slamming at 1am on. I called the front desk, they sent a security guard who did arrive and talk to them. However, the noise continued for another 30 minutes. I didn't think I needed to have to call again...they should have been checking on it. I also, could NOT get on the internet, although I used the correct password. Then, in the morning, I wanted to make some REAL coffee....but, all that was there was decaf. I called the desk...nobody could bring me a packet. Disappointing.
__label__very_positive	The Motel was very comfortable and clean. The owners Mary and Rose couldn't have been nicer and treated us like family. The Staff were very efficient. This wasn't our first time there and we will not stay anywhere else when we go the Hampton Beach.

__label__neutral	Overall it was a great place to stay but the complimentary breakfast was horrible. It started at 8 and my bfs and I got there about 8:45 there was only 1 gal of milk in there sitting out on the counter but there was about 1/2 a cup left. There was no other milk anywhere so that meant no cereal. There was a couple Rice Krispies in a container and a few butter Danish that were broken but that's it. Basically we each ended up with a cup or juice. There wasn't stuff to make the oatmeal that was on the counter either. So breakfast sucked but the room was great.
__label__very_positive	Best night ever in New Orleans!
__label__positive	Overnight visit
__label__very_positive	We stayed here for a staff retreat, one night. Check-in was quick and easy, and the staff were very friendly. We made friends during the cocktail hour with beer and snacks, and the breakfast met our needs. Very comfortable room, great room coffee, and super-easy access to much of what this area has to offer.
__label__neutral	Brief visit
__label__very_positive	This was our second time staying at this hotel. The price is very reasonable for what you get. It is right on the water, an easy walk to the ferry, straight across the lake from Bellagio. It is a beautiful, old fashioned style, grand hotel. The lobby is lovely, the breakfast is fantastic, and the views are amazing. The rooms are small but clean. Free parking was easy to find. You can pay a bit more to get a larger room with a balcony. There are plenty of places to sit on the terrace and look out at the lake, the villas, the mountains and Bellagio. The people were very friendly too. We will be back!
__label__positive	The hotel is great for the value. It has a nice river beach area for swimming and jet ski rentals. It wasn't too crowded, but it was a very hot day. The pools were very crowded to the point that swimming in them wasn't enjoyable. The casino is nice and spacious. The property offers quite a few restaurant options and a large gift shop / convenience store. The outside / entrance to the hotel casino could use a little extra care. It's starting to show the first signs of being neglecte and outdated. The river side of the hotel is kept up much better. The buffet is a good price and the food was okay for the money. Some of the items like the salmon and roast beef were way over cooked . The staff was friendly except for a man at the rewards counter who didn't give us all the information we needed about our rewards cards and had an attitude like we were bothering him. Everyone else made up for his poor service. Half the casino is non smoking which is nice too. Over all Id go back for a quick getaway.

__label__very_positive	Needed a night and this super 8 was very surprisingly close to perfect for us. Wasn't rated high by hotels.com but a lot higher by customers and we found out why. Very nice.
__label__positive	The Hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. The rooms were fine. There was a mini fridge, microwave, hair dryer, and ironing board/iron. However the showers were awful. The water would get scalding hot and then ice cold. At first we thought it was because everyone was returning from the beach but it continued. The Hotel is in a great location-5 block walk to beach, boardwalk, restaurants, shops and entertainment. The pool was nice with not many people there. All in all experience was fine-I would probably return because the price was good and the only bad thing was the showers.

__label__very_positive	Great place to stay
__label__positive	Although the bedrooms could do with more of an up to date design, they are very large and comfortable and with a good size bathroom. Good staff and good cleanliness, the hotel in right in the middle of a golf club away from the road and has a great spa and pool. However the gem in the crown is the top quality restaurant. The whole lot make this a perfect place for a relaxing time. I just enjoyed it.

__label__neutral	My girlfriend and I stayed here as a alternative to staying at the Casino. The biggest fail was the parking. They basically force you to pay for valet. There is public parking a couple blocks away that costs 6/day, but the valet was 10/day. Which I was cool with, but there was only one valet attendant. We stood there for awhile until I finally went in to ask to get my car parked. When we checked out, they had no idea where the keys were. I had to go into the key room and find my keys. So, yeah might wanna fine tune that process. Other than that, it was as good as it could of been for what we paid for. We had breakfast down in the restaurant which took about 30- 40 min to get our food. There was only 1 waitress working. She did as good as 1 person could do. We felt bad for her. We will stay again, I mean its Battle Creek for crying out loud. You get what you pay for!

__label__very_positive	Great Hotel!
__label__neutral	I realize it was a low cost stay..72.xx but cleanliness shouldn't cost money. It was obvious the floor had not been vacuumed or either the vacuum cleaner was broken. The top of the commode was clean but the bottom was nasty. The bottom of the bathtub also looked very dirty. Nothing that a Mr. Clean magic eraser wouldn't take care of. It was 90 + degrees Saturday. The air conditioner did not cool off the room for several hours. Very uncomfortable. Our room was prepaid but the clerk asked for my card anyways, which confused me. She didn't offer to tell me why. Later, I found out it was supposedly for a damage deposit. Thank God it began to cool before bed time. On the positive side, the bedding was comfortable. Would NOT stay here again.

I had to stand out in the cold and wait till someone else came to check me in. Then that process a bit unorganized and the girl didn't give me my driver's license back and i didn't know it till the next morning at check out. and I only found out then because instead of leaving the keys in the room like I usually do I decided to go to the lobby and check out.

__label__negative	This hotel is showing its age. Although my room was clean, everything seemed a little run-down. The carpets seemed old and the door frame had light from the hallway shining through it. The security latch was loose and missing at least one screw. I booked the room in a hurry for a last minute trip. When I got to Watervilled I remembered there are some much nicer places to stay such as the Hampton Inn and the Fireside Inn. For some reason I didn't see these on the hotels.com website.

__label__very_negative	The minute I got to the room, I knew it was not non-smoking. It had been sprayed so heavily it stunk. I HAVE SEVERE ALLERGIES. I IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE DESK AND ASKED FOR A DIFFERENT ROOM, They said they were booked solid. I called them a few minutes later and told them I would only stay the nite because of the 24 hr. cancellation policy. I was so sick the next morning I checked out and asked for a receipt for the one night, she said I didn't need it. TodayI got my bill for 449.86, not the '112. it should have been.
__label__negative	Not worth the price.
__label__neutral	This was supposed to be a nice weekend away for my fiance and I. It was during finals week, and since I also work for housing on campus, it's the busiest time of the year with everyone moving out. I really needed to just get away for a night to keep my sanity. Upon checking in, the staff was fairly nice. However the next morning, I felt as though we were being judged for being young. Both of us are 21, and it felt as though the staff were annoyed with us from the moment we walked downstairs for breakfast.
__label__very_positive	The hotel in under renovations, would have been nice to know. However,it is going to be great when completed. Our room was one of the completed rooms and it was great! The gentlemen who was the night desk clerk was friendly and accommodating, as was the lady working the breakfast. The breakfast was well stocked and fresh. Pool was only opened from 10 to 10, that was a negative. The desk clerk working the morning we checked out was a bit grumpy!

__label__very_negative	We booked online in Dec. for a king room with outside entrance. This was available and paid for immediately on booking.When we got to the hotel after the allowed check-in time, we were told that they did not have that room available. We offered to stay in a 2 bed room, either double beds or queens. At this time one of the 2 girls at the counter proceeded to go to clean a room! We said just to give us a smoking king instead and we would make do with that. As we drove around the hotel to where our room was located, we noticed curtains hanging off windows in some rooms and others appeared that the lining may have been ripped away. We opened the door to the room and closed it again...it was very small, dirty and smelly !! We went back to the desk and said we could not stay there and requested our money back. They said that there was a no refund policy. I realized this when I booked but they were not able to deliver the room which I had paid for so should have made the exception because of this. We did not stay at the hotel but decided to continue on to another city to find accommodations. This is the first bad review that I have given a hotel. We are happy having a clean room and bathroom and comfortable bed and don't require much more than that. We are senior citizens who have travelled extensively and I have never booked a hotel as terrible as this one. I want to let everyone know that it is not as pictured online and suggest that they avoid this hotel.

__label__very_positive	5 min walk to Saint Marco Square--great location!
__label__very_positive	Excellent customer service, clean and comfortable room during our trip to Abilene, Texas. It is near shopping, Walmart, Target and great restaurants in the area. Speedy and friendly when checking in and when checking out.
__label__positive	Great for the money
__label__very_positive	The motel was very nice place and the staff were great at all time. They were ready to help all the time. My wife sister died while we were there. They could not do enough for us. The only thing is they keep it to cold at he front desk and restaurant. We would stay there the next time we go buy.

__label__very_negative	It was not very good the room did not reflect the pictures you saw of rooms on the website. There was nothing myself or my wife liked about the room what so ever
__label__very_positive	Place to stay for business
__label__very_positive	Very convenient for going to cruise ship next day. Fantastic seafood restaurants in Slidell, too. We loved extensive choices for breakfast and friendly staff. Will definitely stay here again and avoid disappointments of New Orleans hotels with parking fees and rooms that never look like what you saw on line !
__label__very_positive	The staff there are so awesome. Very patient helpful! THANK YOU, DANIEL, One of my favorites who work there! He's very kind and helped out A lot when I needed it! Through a tough time, he'll make sure you're okay put a smile on your face.

__label__positive	My stay was VERY COMFORTABLE. The staff are extremely accommodating. The ONLY negative thing I can think of was that it allows smoking in the casino lobby areas. I would come back again!
__label__very_positive	It was a great time with my family when we visited Boston and decided to stay at the holiday inn express in Cambridge.

__label__negative	Our room wasn't ready. We showed up at 3:30 waited till 4:00 to get into our room. Check in is at 3:00. There was never any complimentary cookies, the dish was always empty. No hot water for cocoa. The pool was dirty. Our room was clean comforable. However, disappointed with our stay. Won't stay at this hotel again.
__label__neutral	Conveniently located, that's about it!
__label__positive	I was in town for one night, and this was a perfect place to sleep for the night. Clean, quiet, and convenient.
__label__very_positive	Excellent experience.
__label__neutral	The neighborhood leaves something to be desired big time. They are renovating, the new rooms are very nice, however, I had a cold/lukewarm shower each day.
__label__very_positive	Very nice stay!
__label__very_negative	this inn is not even one star , the room was very small, the mattress was very old, broken and uncomfortable. Very old towels, The so called breakfast was cereal and coffee in a small room with one table and three chairs, we did not even try to have their coffee. Swimming pool water dirty, we could not swim in it. This place is worse than road side motels which cost 50 a night. You should visit the place, so you can see what I mean. We demand our money back.
__label__positive	The staff were really helpful and cheerful. The hotel was centrally located and easy walk to station and centre. The cocktail bar was the only thing stopping it getting a 5. The bar ran out of ice and the batman didn't really know how to make cocktails. Overall a definite recommend .. Nice size rooms with balcony

__label__very_positive	Awesome
__label__very_positive	Staff was helpful and very accommodating. The breakfast and dinner buffet's are great when feeding a whole family. Much better than the continental breakfasts that most hotels offer. Plus each adult gets three free drinks for happy hour. Add it up and great value for the price!
__label__very_positive	Purpose of the visit was a conference in National Harbor.  Greeted by a lovely staff who held our bags and got us in to the room in an hour ( way before checkin time!) by calling us at a nearby restaurant.  Plus, we were not part of another large wedding group.  Loved the room: comfortable bed, shower was great, super clean overall!  Location is excellent!  Near shops and lots of restaurants, Starbucks and CVS right out the door.  Not close to metro, so we took cabs to all the sights.  Wine for free everyday for one hour where we met many nice people.  Well behaved dogs are welcome.   Second time with Kimpton, and I decided to join their rewards program.  Outstanding in every way!
__label__very_negative	DIPLORABLE HOTEL
__label__negative	Disappointing, but it was on the cheap side, so I guess you get what you pay for sometimes. Rooms were pretty dirty and things seemed outdated. We used the pool and the staff gave my wife a hard time asking for 5 pool towels. If we were rude people, we would have told them off, but we are sometimes overly considerate. This is our chance to tell everyone what we think now. They allow pets here and so things just seemed on the dirty side. Hotel staff, as I indicated, were borderline rude. They were busy when we got there, but no reason to roll your eyes at us. Seriously I wonder what happened to Southern Hospitality and the customer is always right It's not like we asked for anything out of the ordinary. Consequently, we stayed at the Best Western (Downtown Nashville) on our way back through town: Much cleaner. Much nicer. Updated. Very comfortable beds. Excellent (Continental) breakfast. Friendly staff. We will be staying there next time for sure. A little more, but worth it.
__label__very_positive	Never disappointed with Hampton Inns!
__label__positive	Two parents, one 11yo son. Two nights in 301 -- two areas (livingroom w tv and ipod dock bed area w 2 twin beds). Rooms connectd by hall w main door. Bed area not totally separate from hall but private enough for family. Bathroom sparkly clean. Separate sink and shower room toilet and sink room. Both small but adequate adequate and and high end fixtures. Lots of higher quality, well thought out amenities -- magnifying mirrors in both sink areas wonderful windows that either swing open or pull in at the top for air sewing kit and Qtips safe plenty of closet and storage space. View into courtyard is quite lovely (from bedroom). View out the livingroom was the cleanest city alley I've ever seen. And the smell of grilled steak wafting in was heavenly. There was was mild kitchen noise from the restaurant that provided the smells, but I thought of it as an experience in daily life...imagining the preparations, the serving, the clean up. It wasn't too loud, just background noise until about 11p and then quiet. We stayed T/W nights so cant speak to weekend noises. Dom bells heard in the distance but not loud. Trains not loud, either. Good central location for easy exploring. Would stay here again.
__label__very_positive	Very good to stay
__label__very_positive	My husband and I stayed here for 1 night on a weekend getaway. The hotel was very nice and very comfortable. Front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. This is a more upscale Hampton Inn. Breakfast was good and plentiful. Our only complaint was that we asked for extra towels, as there were only 2 in the room, and after the front desk called them and told me housekeeping was on their way, they never showed up. Other than the towel issue, our stay was great.
__label__very_positive	Good value with great benefits
__label__positive	Super 8 has stepped up their game!
__label__positive	New Years with the girlfriend had a good time before heading back to work. We live 2 hours away so it was perfect. I always enjoy staying at a Hampton inn. Breakfast is good and rooms are usually clean.
__label__positive	pays out better that the other casinos
__label__positive	A clean newer room with all the usual amenities. No king beds were available and room would be quite tight with a king anyway. Exterior door didn't work with swipe card in PM and again in AM. After reporting it,it worked later that day. All in all, a good stay.
__label__very_positive	Nice hotel close to beach
__label__positive	Quick trip there, but great service, Room was very nice and clean and quiet, bed was comfortable and the staff was very friendly. Would stay there again. Great Location. and Great advise on seeing the California Coast.

__label__neutral	We stayed 2 nights with our family and the hotel was very nice to look at. The breakfast was great and the views from the terrace were beautiful. Our room was nice but we found ants in our room! We told the reception about this and they said they sent a bellboy to spray the bathroom. Unfortunately, this only drove the ants from the bathroom into our bedroom and they got into our luggage and beds. The ants even bit us on our legs and arms! We asked the front desk if we could change rooms but they were completely booked. Since we had a to catch an early morning train, we couldn't talk to the manager. If you can get a room that's ant-free, you'll like this hotel. The breakfast is great, views are spectacular, staff are friendly and it's a short ferry ride to Bellagio too.
__label__positive	Service was great.
__label__neutral	Just OK - nothing special
__label__very_negative	We left after seeing 2 rooms. Filthy, do not know how this got a 3 star rating. The rooms have not been deep cleaned in years and are not cleaned properly each day! Couch had many stains from god knows what..... would not touch them. The walls were dirty, even the light switch which was white was gray to black. The carpet was torn in several places. It also appeared that they rent to permanent residence that didn't appear to be the best in the world. My wife was so concerned with the people she saw, she won't even allow me to go to the lobby without her. The outside also looks rundown. This property needs a total renovation. The clear was helpful and saw that we got out money back.
__label__very_positive	The free WiFi didn't work very well. It was disappointing considering I have teens. The staff was very friendly. The location was perfect! We truly enjoyed our visit.

__label__positive	Nice bed and the sheets were nice. It was located near 53.
__label__neutral	Affordable for a 3 night stay. It was clean and bed was comfortable. Our room once had a picture over the bed because the nails were still in the wall....no picture! If you are just going to sleep there it's ok. If you are looking for a nice looking room, go elsewhere. The so called breakfast was terrible. Didn't even have lids for the coffee, which tasted like poison :(
__label__very_negative	try the spa!
__label__positive	We drove in for a concert, but didn't want to stay in town. Candlewood Huntersville was affordable and a great location. There are lots of things to do around the hotel, i.e., dining, shopping, Birkdale Village, and uptown Charlotte is only minutes away. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The room was quiet and comfortable. A very enjoyable stay. This will be my go-to hotel for future trips to the Charlotte area.

The price is a bit high but so is everything else in Telluride. The breakfast at Columbia is awesome! I highly recommend this hotel for a short or long stay.
__label__neutral	Hotel was clean and convenient location to down town and the 40
__label__very_positive	This hotel was very clean and great for a little weekend getaway. I was heading to Erie to go for wine country. The hotel was easy access to the highway making it a quick trip to the local wineries. Only really needed the room for a place to sleep at night, and it suited that need just fine. Complimentary breakfast was a voucher for McDonalds, located next door, which was great! Another perk, my dog was able to stay for free. I didn't have to be put in a pet block of rooms, nor did the room smell of animals. I would definitely stay here again!
__label__positive	This hotel has a nice charm; not your cookie cutter luxury hotel. The staff was nice, the location in old town is perfect.
__label__very_positive	We had a very nice stay accommodations are very comfortable. The only negative we had is the shower kept going from hot to cold and back to hot again it would not maintain a constant temperature. We would definitely stay here again and hopefully the next room will have a shower that will stay at the temperature we like
__label__very_positive	Stay was great staff was friendly and kind and room was good.
__label__negative	I stayed here with a couple friends the night before doing the Seattle Rock n Roll half marathon. We live a little under an hour away, so we were just coming up for the evening. We called early in the day to inquire about parking and were told that the Inn had their own parking lot so it was no problem to pay to park when we arrived later. Well, when we checked in we were told the parking lot was full, sorry. I was shocked and disappointed that no other explanation or assitance was given. The lady at reception simply handed me a map of some nearby lots and suggested we just park on the street. Well, good luck finding street parking on a Friday evening! We drove around for over an hour until we could find a spot. We then had to move our car in the morning before the race. This was a huge inconvenience. We stopped by hotel reception after driving around for an hour to inquire about late check-out. We were told the hotel doesn't offer late check-out, and even after explaining our frustration about driving around for an hour (or more) looking for parking, she simply said, there's nothing I can do. We were very disappointed in the lack of service, lack of genuine apology, and absence of any sort of gesture for our inconvenience. Needless to say, we will not be back.
__label__very_positive	Elevators in the middle are crazy!Driving in to register was amazing due to staff being able to keep up & bell staff were friendly! Get highest floor for views & walk right outside to times square!

__label__very_negative	Non-Smoking room smelled like smoke outer bedding covers looked dirty breakfast room was inadequate and poorly stocked not enough food and beverage for the people attending. Road noise was horrible when the window was open to let out smoke smell because of allergies. Hotel amenities the worst ever encountered e.g., no bottled water on the premises. I was told to go to a local service station to get some.
__label__positive	The hotel was adequate and met my basic needs. It met my expectations for this type of hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful. The TV was difficult to use - you couldn't get directly to a specific channel and it didn't have all the network channels, presumably b/c it was DirectTV. The continental breakfast consisted of coffee/tea and muffins so I wouldn't really call it a continental breakfast.
__label__negative	The room was in okay shape. Bath room could use some work, seemed clean but there were a lot of finish issues.
__label__neutral	Ideal location to Cedar Point and the Lake Erie islands. Comfortable and clean.

__label__negative	A young gentleman named devin was very helpful for me the rest of the staff were no good. The air-conditioning system didn't work right room was to hot. By far one of the worst hotels in have ever stayed at. Maybe some day it will be a better place if they change some of their staff.

__label__negative	I stood on the front lobby to check on and wasn't acknowledged for at least 5 minutes and then was told I assume you are checking in. That's not the best way to welcome a customer staying at your hotel! You should make them feel welcome and want to stay. If there were more choices in Boone I would have walked out and canceled my stay there! They need to work on hospitality!

__label__very_positive	Despite reservation, this hotel was overbooked. They sent me next door to quality in, which was a cheap suite with motel 6 feel. It felt unsafe, and unclean. Even with my best effort I could not locate another hotel. The next day I was able to go to Comfort in, but because of the area, and being bumped. I will never return.

__label__negative	Free coffee refills and budget rates make this motel tops with highway travelers. In ShortThe first Super 8 opened in Aberdeen, S.D., in 1974, charging 8.88 a night. Today, the national franchise, with its familiar red-and-yellow sign, still stands for dependable rooms at wallet-friendly prices. A staple for road-tripping families, truck drivers and tour groups, the motel offers complimentary morning coffee and continental breakfasts. Another perk for travelers: Super 8 travel cups may be refilled for free at any of the motel's locations.
__label__positive	Great location
__label__positive	Just what we needed. Quiet and comfortable.
__label__very_positive	Great location but a little underwhelmed
__label__neutral	Just OK
__label__negative	The price and location were pretty good. The appeal for this hotel over others was that it had free wifi which we needed for business purposes the next morning. The price for the night was pretty good and the room was very well kept. However due to a lightening storm before we arrived the wifi was out of service, but we were assured it would be up within a half hour. The staff were very limited in what they could do to fix the router, and by the next morning, we missed our conference call. Very displeased with Super 8's ability to fix it's wifi, would have stayed elsewhere if we had known it would be an issue.

__label__positive	It was a nice place for the price we paid. The pool is rather small and outdoors which was unexpected and a little disappointing. The room was comfortable and clean. Though the TV didn't allow you to change the input which was disappointing so we could not use the TV to watch Netflix from our Roku or computer.
__label__very_positive	This was a great place for us to stay. We loved the hotel itself, and it was so close to shops and restaurants. The staff at the Green Mill restaurant adjoining the hotel also had great customer service.
__label__positive	it was nice and ok.
__label__positive	The main reason they lose a star is the lack of continental breakfast. Instead, they give a voucher for a McDonald's breakfast. I guess McDonald's breakfast is better than no breakfast, but still a bummer. Aside from that, staying here was a good experience.

__label__very_negative	My room had a sink that would clog. It also leaked from underneath the sink onto the floor. I advised the hotel staff about the leak and was told they will have someone there to fix the same day. I was there for three nights and it was never fixed. The shower water pressure was very low and came out as a drizzle. The temperature fluctuated while taking a shower as well from cold to very hot and to cold again. The bed felt very lopsided. The pillows where old and collapsing and smashed. There was little flying nats or bugs flying around in the room. I will never stay there again and will advise all those that I know and don't know to not stay there as well.
__label__very_positive	We had a lovely room (probably recently refurbished) - very big with lots of light.

__label__positive	I booked this hotel because it was easy to transfer to and from the train station traveling between Florence and Venice. It is indeed just around the corner from the station, yet still within easy walking distance from car rentals and the town centre. Our flight into Italy was delayed by 12 hrs with the result that we got to Florence on the morning of our check-out day. The staff was extremely helpful, and offered the room to us until 6pm that afternoon, which allowed us to have a shower, breakfast, and still see a couple of sights before leaving for the Tuscany countryside.

__label__very_positive	Our room had been renovated and was exceptional. The loft concept is very well executed. Great decor and very well laid out. However the hotel was under renovation in the main and lower lobby. It will be a great look once finished. Service was impeccable, greeting was very good and team caring about breakfast was very hospitable. Well located the hotel is a great choice.
__label__very_negative	Having stayed at other locations operated by this chain, I knew not to expect 4 or 5 star lodging, but I did expect more than what we experienced. The hotel ( more like a motor inn), for its part, seems to be trying to improve, but, it still needs a lot of work. The easiest way for me to do this is to list all of the issues we had, so, here goes: 1. Non-smoking room next to a smoking room a room that still reeks of stale cigarette smoke. 2. There was daylight coming through gaps at the top and bottom of the door frame, thus allowing the cool air to escape and the heat and humidity in. 3. Climate control! The ac was set at 76 degrees and we couldn't override the temp to try to make the room more comfortable. 4. Loud and unruly guests and there children hanging in the parking lot very late making tons of noise. 5. Being awakened at 5:30 am on a Saturday to the screams of a woman fighting with her boyfriend right outside our door! 6. After finally getting back to sleep after the incident mentioned in 5, being re-awakened at 9 am on the same Saturday by the sounds of the building being power washed. (refer to 2 and, yup, you guessed it, water coming in under the crack)

__label__negative	Its rated as a three and a half Stars more likstar
__label__neutral	The outside of the hotel needs work. There are ceiling tiles missing outside of the room doors. The lobby appeared to be newly redone and was very comfortable. The security was exceptional. Having to use the room key to access the elevator is a big plus. However, once the elevator doors opened up on the third floor, I was very disappointed. The carpets were old and tattered, especially where the carpet was pieced together. I took a picture of the carpet but am unable to take it off my phone. Once we entered our room, it was very small for two adults, a twelve year old boy, and his cousin who was a seven year old girl. We had brought an inflatable mattress for the seven year old girl to sleep on and we were unable to set it up. So, we had to make different sleeping arrangements because I was uncomfortable with the cousins sleeping together. The bed that I slept in was very uncomfortable. I woke up with a backache every morning. I will not be recommending this hotel to anyone.
__label__very_positive	Lovely room, great upscale neighborhood, would definitely come back. Best shower ever, delicious breakfast, hot, always restocking, good variety. TV channels did not include leisure channels like TVLAND, HGTV, or Foodnetwork which would have been fun for some easy relaxing.
__label__neutral	I got this room through Expedia.  The hotel gave me one of the worst rooms they could.  I have stayed there before when I made the reservations directly through the hotel and the room was MUCH better.  This room overlooked the back roof of the hotel, was as far away from the elevator as possible and was very small.  I think the hotel gives the worst rooms to the third party sellers.
__label__very_positive	Great Stay!
__label__very_positive	Great food
__label__neutral	Check in was great. The girl at the counter was really nice and let me check in a little early. Coffee and tea both in the lobby and in the room--along with a microwave and a refrigerator. I booked this hotel because I was a woman travelling alone and I liked the inside corridors. But that safety feature was blown out of the water because they prop the doors at both ends of the hallway open all day. The pool was dirty, but I didn't use it, but if I wanted to, I wouldn't have. In the morning there was a homeless person walking through the hallways and going through the garbage. The decor was old and worn (holes in the draperies), but it appeared passably clean. 2 soups, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, a make-up remover pacakge, Q-tips, and cotton balls were all provided. Breakfast was OK. Lots of pre-packaged food, but the eggs they advertised were obviously powdered--they were in the shape of squares! Cereal, muffins, bread, toaster, no peanut butter, boiled eggs, cheese slices (american), hot sausage and a waffle maker. So that was OK. At 167 with tax it's one of the cheaper places in Sunnyvale and if you're just there for the night because you have to go to family court down the street, it's OK. I have to go there again next month and I'll probably stay here again--but if I had more money, it would NOT be my choice.
__label__positive	Great romantic getaway.
__label__very_negative	The most repelling thing is the smell. It is not only an older facility but reeks of stale cigarette smoke even in a non smoking room. Even the lobby had a stench. Not worth even a good price. Beds were uncomfortable. Bathroom old and I didn't even want to shower there. Would NOT stay here again.....would keep driving.

__label__positive	Grace was so helpful and has a contagious personality which made our stay a pleasure. The property was clean even though it could use some cosmetic updates. The breakfast was more than expected. This is our second stay at the hotel and expect to return again next year. Thank you for a wonderful start to our vacation.
__label__very_negative	I wasn't expecting a 5 star stay, but wasn't prepared for the hole in the wall, no lock on the bathroom door, shower shooting all over, or the ants and ripped carpet. Or the carpet so dirty my kids feet were black. And walls so thin we couldn't sleep because our neighbors were having a good time till 4am. For 100 a night, I expected at least decent. Never again!
__label__very_positive	We had some issue checking in after booking through Hotels.com. After about 10 minutes and showing the clerk our confirmation, they were able to confirm and show us as registered guests. The hotel clerk staff seemed to indicate and issue with Hotels.com bookings. After that issue, all was well. Our room was very nice and the hotel was clean and looked well kept. The slopes were just right outside the L2 terrace, and the staff was very friendly. The hotel does charge a 15/day parking fee, but the valet service was very good, and provided our vehicle very quickly. Many of the lounges and bars have entertainment from 3pm until 11pm. The food was good, but a little more expensive than you would typically expect - what else would you expect from a resort, though All in all, it was a very good experience.

__label__neutral	Came for a family getaway weekend. Chose this hotel because of reasonable price and both indoor and outdoor pools and hot tub, and proximity to downtown Hyannis. Staff and room were pleasant. Walk to town was a little longer than we would have preferred. The outdoor pool was cold because of the weather, but the indoor pool was also very chilly and we were extremely disappointed to see the hot tub had been ripped out. Also, we would have liked to check out at 7:30 am, but the office was still closed. We could have called to have someone come out, but chose to come back later. Overall, a nice enough place for the price, but no extras.

__label__neutral	Arrived hoping for a double bed but was told there were ONLY 4 double beds in the hotel and they were taken. The food was terrible so we ate out most of the time. The beds were awful... We changed rooms but still the beds are comfortable. Also no heating so rooms were cold and the flooring was worse. Most of the guests were oap's so really not a place for the under 40's. Would suggest a new review rating be done.... 3* and that's pushing it.

__label__very_negative	This hotel is quite run down, and in need of rehabilitation. In my room, the sink was cracked, the tub was chipped, and the shower controls damaged. The bed mattress was a tad worn as well, and the AC unit didn't seem to heat or cool to the stated temperature. At one point, the room was around 68 and cool, so I heated it up to 72. The unit ran for about 2 minutes before shutting off, ineffectively heating the room. I didn't expect much as this was a last minute rental, and its' proximity to downtown Aiken was nice.

__label__very_negative	This is the most disguisting motel that I have ever been to. They have rodents, and the shower doesn't even work. They put inappropiate cat stuff in the thing under the window. The air out of the conditioner smells so nasty. I would not reccommend this motel to anybody ever.
__label__negative	I often stay at Hampton Inns but one was not conveniently located so I opted for this Fairfield Inn near Bingham ton because it seemed to be about the same quality although a little pricier. What a mistake ! The motel, although the room was clean and comfortable, was very unattractive and way overpriced for the amenities. I would have walked out but I had a no cancellation reservation. When I mentioned the unattractiveness to the desk clerk she acknowledged the problem and very nicely explained that the place was due for a major overhaul. So. if the management knew it was not up to snuff why the high rate. This experience guarantees that I will avoid Fairfield in the future and recommend that other travelers stay away also

Once we had our keys, the hotel door we went in nearest our room, had damage, the walls were scuffed and filthy. The room had a disgusting odor not sure if it was moldy, musty, or what.

So we decided to rent the lovely Le Geant chalet, where we could walk around in sweatpants, lounge around the fireplace and talk about the upcoming year. This was a huge success, i dont think we will be going back to the hotel scenario again. We cooked together, ate around the long dinner table, drank beer, took long walks in the afternoon, and - oh yes - got a lot of work done. The environment was perfect for accomplishing the bonding experience you hope to gain in such a gathering.

__label__very_positive	Clean and quiet!
__label__positive	Surprised to be disappointed
__label__neutral	We used our hotel room as a place to keep our stuff and get some rest while visiting family. The hotel choices in this area are rather limited. It seemed like they were conserving energy since the lobby was well lit but the rest of the building was rather dark. No lights in the swimming area or around the restaurant in the evening which was a little strange.
__label__positive	Dated but in a great location

__label__very_positive	Nice place to stay
__label__very_positive	I love visiting VB and really enjoy Thai hotel. The staff is friendly. The rooms are great. Free delicious breakfast. The kids enjoy the pool. The rooms all face the ocean and have a great view. Definitely would recommend for family or a couples outing.
__label__neutral	Place is really clean. Staff is helpful. Breakfast is just cereal, bread, juice and coffee or tea. Waffle We are not sure if we can call that waffle. It will be good if the hotel add little more to the breakfast.
__label__neutral	No indoor pool
__label__negative	it was good but the bed was nosey and there was people fighting in the other room they should have security
__label__very_positive	ottimo per fermarsi durante un viaggio
__label__neutral	The hotel was good for the price, and with a welcoming staff. Free internet ran smoothly. My biggest problem was the overall room way too humid and stuffy. It was very hard to breath as if mold was in the room. It took me 2 hours to air out the room.
__label__positive	Lovely Hotel. Shuttle service only goes to Regan Airport not Dullas, we had some confusion, but the staff made it up to me. I would stay there again.

__label__very_positive	Main issue with this room: You can only connect one wi-fi device at one time. When you have several people with phones, iPads and a laptop, this was a challenge. Otherwise, enjoyed my stay.
__label__very_positive	Very comfortable and clean. Close to the Casino boats. Hard to get out on main hwy to make a left. Wish there was a traffic light. Most comfortable pillows and mattress that I have slept on since Helen, Ga.
__label__positive	When Humboldt County roads give you lemons--or slides across the highway--and you are in Garberville, this is your place. Really nice rooms, pool/hot tub, surprisingly quiet (and the place was full the night we were there). Staff is typical for the area, just be patient, all will get done. Typical motel breakfast in the mornings.
__label__very_positive	My husband and I drove from NY to Florida to go on a cruise. We did not get there until 1am. The lady behind the desk was VERY welcoming and friendly. The room was clean, the bed Was comfortable and the lady in the morning wished us a good trip. We were VERY happy the lady told us about the shuttle service !we will use this hotel in the future for all our cruises that we book ! Thank you!

__label__positive	Good location, easy access to Beltway
__label__positive	The staff was were nice and friendly, the room was really clean, the water pressure was great, the breakfast was good, however I barely slept because I could hear people out in the hall talking until very late. They even had their doors propped open so they could talk. Also, could hear through the walls, toilets flushing, showers running, and people talking. I did say something about the noise as we checked out and they said it was because they had several wedding parties, etc. going on and they usually try not to put people not involved in that near them, however they couldn't help it. Other than no sleep, it was nice.

__label__positive	I had booked for and paid for a two queen bed room thru expedia.  When I checked in I realized it was a two double bed.  The front desk staff did not even mention that to me at the time of check in. I mentioned this to them when I was checking out and they told me to contact Expedia.  One of the beds were broken and it was titling to one side.
__label__very_negative	Worst hotel

__label__very_positive	Exceptionally Clean Friendly
__label__positive	We were traveling through Knoxville. Found this Best Western through AARP. Had overnighted in this area before several times. This was the most comfortable motel we have found and will definitely plan to return to it.
__label__neutral	The pros: close to downtown Kona and actually on the coast. There is no beach, but the volcanic rocks below our room housed all sorts of crabs, fish and eels to check out. The room had a washer and dryer, which are essential for a longer stay or if you plan on doing a lot of beach activities The cons: Old, hard beds. The air conditioning was a wall unit and did not reach into the bedroom. The only reason that we stayed was the Murphy bed in the front room. We were cool and could watch the sunset from bed. The WiFi is very slow. Individual units are owned by different people, so finishes vary. We were in D34
__label__neutral	Average
__label__positive	Other than it was very hard to find on Garmin we finally found it with Google. Very nice location.

__label__very_positive	Good hotel.The only problem I had was that I reserved a smoking room,had confirmation,and when I checked in I was told they had no more and that I would have to go outside and smoke,which would not of been a problem if I didn't have confirmation and if it hadn't rained all weekend
__label__very_positive	The room was very nice and the hotel was quiet. Since we were visiting for Parent Weekend at OU, we only stayed one night. However, with the full kitchen, this would be a great place for an extended stay as well. We would definitely stay here again even though it was a little tricky to get to when coming from Norman.
__label__negative	Needs updating.

__label__positive	We stay here quite frequently and love the friendly welcome from the front desk staff. The staff in the bar and Starwood lounge are also top notch.

__label__positive	I had issues with a broken pull out couch bed they couldn't replace and a clogged bathroom sink because it was the weekend and no maintenance was available. They comped me on my stay and gave me a free night. I also had to kill a couple big spiders in the room.
__label__neutral	Arrived late, not surly, but not the friendliest check in . Room typical, sofa way too soft. Bathroom good, beds very comfortable, nice little fridge etc. Breakfast bar typical, what were those yellow turds I think they were eggs, probably powdered eggs with not enough butter or water added, glowing yellow color, no thanks.

__label__very_positive	Super hotel
__label__neutral	We recently spent a night at Homewood Suites while we visited the MOA. The location was great, right across the street from the Mall. The downside is that you are also close to the airport and we could hear the planes from our room, but that really didn't bother us too much. The room was nice and what we expected. Kitchenette was a nice touch to have while having a 16 month old. The separate bedroom was also nice. We did have breakfast that the hotel offered. Waffles, cereal, fruit, toast/bagels, juice, and some other hot items were offered. This was okay. There were cheese omelettes and you could tell they used egg beaters, so I didn't care for those, but otherwise it was fine for breakfast included with your rate. The one negative thing I will say is that Saturday when we checked out, I went down to the front desk around 10am-a very busy time, and the front desk only had one person working. This was terrible. The line was long and people were not happy. For being a weekend, there should have been 2 people working here. One other thing to touch on that didn't bother me so much, but it might some others. When I asked for a receipt, they only email you a receipt, nothing printed. Those who don't use the internet would not like this. Overall, I'd stay here again because of the proximity to what we were visiting and the price.
__label__very_negative	HORRIBLE
__label__positive	very nice
__label__neutral	older hotel. desolate area of interstate. adequate stop over. shower only. most unusual style of shower that i've never seen. carpet a bit tacky to walk on. minimal choice at offered breakfast.
__label__very_positive	Comfortable stay at a decent price
__label__very_negative	It was horrible it was loud and the hotel did nothing to credit me they had teens running around all hours of the night throwing ice, coke cans, and pushing each other on the baggage cart running into the room doors it was unbelievable I got no sleep the 2 nights I stayed there I would not recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to sleep, it is over priced and you have to pay extra to park at the place. They do have a restaurant that's over priced 5.00 for a bowl of grits! and a breakfast buffet but the teens that were staying there were eating out of it with there hands and no one said anything to them they took over this hotel for the weekend. I will never stay there again even if it was free, oh the men that park your car in the morning are very nice that's was the ONLY good thing about this place and don't ask for the manager because he will never call you back he just blows smoke up your butt and avoids you afterwards. Other hotels in Marshal that are better.
__label__very_positive	The staff is very friendly. The rooms are very nice and very comfortable. Nice to have a full kitchen. Loved the fire pit the evening with smores. We will definitely be back. We were even able to watch the whales from the deck of our room. It was amazing!!
__label__very_negative	booked a 2 bed. got a single bed. room was complete garbage. not at all up to any code whatsoever. refused to shower in the shower. bed felt disgusting. luckily i was only there to sleep late at night and leave in the morning because this place is horrible.

__label__very_negative	Serves a great continental breakfast and offers free Wi-Fi.
__label__very_negative	Rude staff, room was stink, sofa bed linens had a terrible odor, the fire alarm sounded every 2 hours in the middle of the night
__label__positive	I was worried about staying here after reading the reviews. I decided to give it a try since the cancellation time had expired. Before paying for my room, I asked to go see the actual room I would be staying in. I checked the bed and didn't see any bugs and the room looked clean, so it would work for us. Of course after asking to look at the room, the guy checking us in was not happy with me. For a 2 star hotel, it was a good value, clean and comfortable. The continental breakfast was better than I thought it would be. There was sausage and egg patties, biscuits and pepper gravy (it was pretty good- a lot better than many other places) and waffles along with the normal bagels, muffins, ect.
__label__very_positive	Nice place to stay. Many updates in the last year. The lobby, and public areas have all been redone. The rooms can stand a little updating but are average for a Best Western. The Internet speed was very fast and they had mult ports. The rooms facing the water can get hot in the afternoon if not cloudy and there... More

__label__neutral	This should tell you a lot, when we got into the room we noticed two sets of Ear plugs, yes Ear plugs. And you needed them, that's how loud the AC unit was. I went to add ice to a small cooler I brought for our trip, and they told me I was not allowed to put ice in the cooler. First time that has ever happened.

__label__very_positive	Great place good location

__label__very_negative	Not worth it!
__label__neutral	The location is good, the hotel was clean, bed was comfortable with basic ammenities. The door passes were strictly for the entering your hotel room. I didn't like that anyone could get in through the back door, which is not typical of today's hotel security. Staff was available at 3PM but not before for check in. The price was right, so not much to complain about really.

__label__very_positive	Great hotel- lots of amenities
__label__positive	Very convenient to downtown Napa and wine country tours. Spacious room with large upgraded bathroom. In fact the bathroom was better quality than the San Francisco Hyatt Regency. The breakfast was decent with fresh fruit and a breakfast sandwich in addition to pastries. In this area you could pay twice as much and not get as good quality. Staff is friendly and helpful.
__label__positive	Convient & Clean Hotel
__label__positive	Front desk was very helpful when we needed medical care on a Saturday morning. Breakfast was limited but okay.
__label__very_positive	My stay at Hotel de la Ville was truly outstanding. A hidden gem. The staff were incredibly helpful, my room was VERY comfortable and the breakfast buffet was fresh with ample selection. Perhaps the greatest attribute of the hotel is its location - within easy walk of all of the major sights and on the BEST shopping street in Florence. I would highly recommend the hotel and would return again.

__label__neutral	We stayed here because I have asthma, so I needed to stay in a smoke-free property. There is nothing fancy about the hotel, but the room was clean, the beds were really comfy, and the free breakfast was a plus. The staff was nice as well, which is always a plus : )
__label__neutral	Worst Hampton Inn
__label__positive	This hotel provided just what we needed for a week family vacation in Paris. We were in the 9th district surrounded by great restaurants and a block from the metro station. They have a great buffet (although no price difference for kids) and are very responsive to needs. Most of the staff were fluent in English.
__label__negative	I won't be back.
__label__very_positive	try the nightly free wine hour from 5:30-6:30.  become a joy of life club member. ask for a room with a bathtub.
__label__very_positive	Convenient location, free parking breakfast and clean room.
__label__negative	Very rude
__label__positive	Hotel staff were very helpful, good location near Longwood, Winterthur, Hagley Museum and other wonderful sites. Breakfast was good with eggs, bacon/sausage as well as usual fare. We stayed 5 days and went to nearby restaurant for several dinners.Only negatives were several towels were bit threadbare and lighting in the room was rather dark. They needed better lighting but overall, very good experience. We would stay there again.

__label__positive	Great! WELL ABOVE AVERAGE!
__label__positive	Great stay plenty to do very helpful. Awesome breakfast......
__label__positive	Good stay, quite place, excellent location, improve bathrooms and improve breakfast. The elevator must have maintenance and actualization for a newer one. The toilets must have a more conformable way of working, and the noise of the extractor is too loud.
__label__very_negative	Terrible. Room filthy, First room ,we couldn't stay after the first night. We took pictures I believe you can find a better quality chair and ottoman at any landfill. Black mold on the shower, someone's used wash cloth on the shower curtain rod. Trash behind night stand and bathroom door and next to the bed on floor. After we complained we were put in another room, the maid made sure mostly things were clean. Put a sheet over the chair and didn't look at it.
__label__negative	Staff were rude when we asked for more towels for our room. The continental breakfast was donuts, toast, apples or Cheerios. The AC in the room could barely keep the room comfortable running on high and the room has a funky smell probably from the food that was under the beds. General appearance of the hotel is pretty run down. Location is great, easy to find right off the interstate but that is the only good thing about the hotel.
__label__positive	Nice
__label__very_positive	Even better than Advertised!
__label__positive	I needed to hole myself up in a hotel...away from distractions, to get urgent work completed for one of my best clients. I chose Old Town because I could take a few breaks, do a little shoping, walking, etc.There were a few hiccups over the weekend but the staff took care of everything and I am pleased and very greatful. I would come back to this hotel anytime!
__label__neutral	Parking
__label__positive	Great location right off highway and next to shopping mall with restaurants and stores.
__label__positive	Un grand Merci
__label__very_positive	Wonderful place
__label__very_positive	I have stayed here a lot and it is always a pleasure. The front desk staff is particularly friendly. There is a charming upper patio with baskets of flowers lovely place to sit. I really appreciate the laundry facilities.
__label__very_positive	Our cabin was surrounded by trees with a view and we felt like we were in a luxurious tree house.  Very secluded.  Loved how convenient it was to everything, too.  Elk Springs is close to the trolley stop so we used that often.  Highly recommend it for a romantic getaway.
__label__negative	I have stayed in several othe Microtel Inn and this one is bar far the worst one. It is very outdated and the room was exceptional small. The towels were paper thin they were so washed out and hard. I had no microwave in the room refrig was ok. The gentleman at the front desk was far from freindly and the lobby consist of a small couch no office center which all the other's had and I use these for business so I need a computer so I don't have to drag my with me. Overall if you just want a place to sleep and a quick shower I guess for the price this will work.

Bathroom faucet handle loose and wobbling all over. I should have read more about room. No in-room coffee pot and shuttle to airport didn't start until 7 a.m., causing me to have to take an additional cab. Not some place I would stay again, but ok. I give it a 3,

__label__positive	We spent 5 nights on a trip to Castle Rock at this Days Inn. Room was clean and well attended each day. The breakfast area was small and at some times all the tables were filled.
__label__neutral	Hotel was not clean during my visit. The breakfast was inadequate and few options. The hotel did not even provide bread. It is in a good location for the purpose of my trip and accessible.
__label__neutral	Great location.. Room needs help
__label__negative	Pretty decent. Breakfast was good. Beds were comfortable. Half of the light bulbs were out. I didn't understand why there was a security deposit, if the room was paid in full.
__label__very_negative	There was a birthday party for a 16 year old going on the night I stayed here. The hotel was extremely loud. The front desk told them to hold it down, but it did not work.i am very unhappy with this hotel. The hotel was overpriced since I had to put up with this noise.

__label__very_positive	fantastic
__label__positive	Had a great stay. Customer Service was great. The only bad thing was the refridgerator was not working and they waited till we left I guess so they can fix it. But they did give us a credit for our ruined items and let us use their fridge up front to store our things. Other then that it was a great stay. Will definitely stay their again.
__label__neutral	Pet friendly without a huge deposit
__label__positive	This is not a 5 star hotel it is a County Inn and Suites but it is a great hotel for the for what we paid. A 5 Star would be far more expensive. However, the hotel exceeded our expectations and offered a great value. Comfortable property with indoor / outdoor pool, decent exercise facility (didn't use either) and offered the ability to go to a local health club as well. Breakfast was included and they had the Coffee and fresh baked cookies available, too. All of the people we who worked there were very friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again. Quick access to UNCC Campus and all surrounding area was also a plus.

__label__positive	Good enough for a simple stay. Checkin and checkout was extremely easy. The staff was very nice. Housekeeping had the rooms cleaned. The breakfast was very good, better than expected. The hotel is dated but if you want a basic stay then this is the place. Close to eating establishments
__label__positive	I was very impressed with the room size, condition of the property, free breakfast, and service.
__label__positive	Rooms are nice, except for outdated furniture and fixtures. Staff was friendly and efficient. Reasonably priced for the area, but could use some remodeling.
__label__very_positive	I would stay at this Best Western when I am back in Morro Bay. It is easy access in town and near the shoreline. It is very close to many restaurants and stores. The rooms were clean and the towels were thick and soft. In fact there were enough towels for everyone. The lobby was lovely and very private.

__label__neutral	Good location right next to canyon entrance. Clean and well kept. But very thin walls, so you need to have neighbours who are quiet!
__label__negative	Decent room. Had fridge, microwave, and TV. Did not have a hair dryer. Tub drained very slowly, carpet was visibly dirty in routinely traveled corners, and the set of sheets for my second night had a small blood stain on them. Quiet though, so good enough place to crash.

Only 2 complaints: 1-Although we used the shuttle for several days to get to/from the Metro, we were never told that the shuttle service ended at 10 PM. Imagine our surprise when returning one night after a Nationals baseball game! 2-On the day we checked out Housekeeping tapped on the door at 8 AM immediately tried to open the door. No waiting, no verbal announcement. Fortunately we had used the inside lock.

__label__very_positive	Lovely stay!
__label__negative	It is under construction but that didn't bother me. It was the bathroom. Yuck. It was poorly laid out. The shower head drizzled. The shower leaked water every where. No bathroom fan. Rooms do not have air conditioning. Pay the extra 10 a night for a view. Our view was of an old falling apart building. People above us were extremely loud. Hard to park with an suv. Parking spaces were small. Breakfast wasn't replenished. So if you weren't there when it started, you had to get your own. If I were to pick again, I wouldn't stay here.

A/C didn't work, shower water pressure is barely there, left over wash rags hanging on the shower from the last guest, and a slight old hotel smell. Told the front desk person about it...she just sighed and said, ok...you'll get a receipt for your stay from Expedia. Then she went back to her business.

She brought up a key within a few minutes and showed us to a different room a few doors down. This room didn't stink but the heat didn't work in this one either. She went back downstairs and got a key to a different room, fortunately the heat worked in this room and even though it stunk we decided to keep this room. I think a lot of the bad smells are caused by the fact that they have smoking rooms right next to nonsmoking rooms. Breakfast was pretty good and presided over by a very sweet, helpful young woman named Samantha. Even though the staff is very nice we will never stay here again and cannot recommend it.

__label__positive	Unexpected stay during Dec '15 Icepocolypse
__label__positive	Love the place close to freeways about 10 miles away from Down Town SF my only complaint is the bed to hard for my back other than that, the Hotel is nice and clean free breakfast before you go out to explore.
__label__neutral	About what you'd expect from a motel 8 - perfectly priced for what we needed.
__label__positive	Courtyard by Marriott was a nice getaway!
__label__neutral	Das Tryp Krefeld liegt sehr weit auerhalb in einem Industriegebiet. Parkpltze sind ausreichend vorhanden. Die Betten knnten bequemer sein. Das Zimmer war zweckmig ausgestattet.
__label__positive	Met our needs quite well.
__label__very_positive	The room was clean and ready when I checked in. Staff was nice and friendly. It's right off interstate, it was by a Denny's. The beds were comfortable.
__label__very_positive	The bathroom floor and shower wall were covered in someone's long black hair. The tub dripped constantly. The floor had not been vacuumed and someone's fingernail clippings were on the floor by the desk. The sliding door was unlocked and the back door to enter the hotel didn't lock after hours. The whole place except the lobby is in disrepair.
__label__very_positive	Could not have had a better time or a better place to stay.
__label__neutral	"I've been traveling over 5 months, staying at 5 star hotels every night. This is the only one thus far that charges for Internet access. If you're paying a few hundred dollars a night for the room, why do you pay for access?On the plus size, even the basic rooms are quite nice, the service is good, and they didn't have a problem with late check out. But this hotel is completely isolated from everything, and just crossing the highway to get to the Big malls across the street is a big hassle. You're better off staying at the Grand Hyatt or Kempenski, which have direct mall access. Also, despite charging a service fee, they try to guilt you into tipping; see the receipt they offer that indicates a tip amount as ""0"" despite a 10% service charge."
__label__very_positive	At first you'd think their lift system is kinda cool, until there are two dozens of people waiting to get on. Then you'll probably welcome the traditional press up and down buttons.
__label__neutral	The only issue with this hotel is the TV are hung on the wall no sound proofing in wall you hear the rooms TV in your room. had to call front desk 3X to get the volume turned down in the room adjacent to mine. BRING EAR PLUGS
__label__very_positive	Pretty
__label__positive	Close to client office
__label__very_positive	It was Great...hotel so far one of the best.
__label__very_negative	The rooms are very average, but the main reason you should NOT stay here is the manager. She is a hateful person and has no concern or care whatsoever for the customers. She has no ability or desire to resolve issues and the rest of the staff does not respect her. Also, the bathtub/showers are ancient and need to be updated. The handle broke into 3 pieces and I had to put it back together. This hotel is in chaos!
__label__neutral	Was not really impressed with the continental breakfast.The staff, for the most part ,were professional and respectful. Yet,the manager was very abrasive and did not make my husband and I feel welcome. It was more like we were an imposition.
__label__negative	My husband and I were traveling through the area and we ended up staying here--and we won't again. First, the rooms are pretty small. Second, the bathtub is LITTLE, really really really LITTLE. It's a joke. Unless you are 6 years old you cannot stretch out in it. That right there pretty much does it for us. Third, the breakfast...

__label__positive	Great place to stay near Canyon de Chelly
__label__negative	Awful Fire alarm went off first night at 1:45am. No staff telling us it was a false alarm. Everybody evacuated. My 70 year old mother hurt herself going down the stairs. Once out, still nobody telling us it was a false alarm and safe to go back in, or that could take elevators back in. Second night, people yelling in the hallways in the middle of the night. Very little sleep either night.
__label__negative	Toilet issues
__label__very_positive	Reception was very welcoming. Complimentary water & fruits on arrival to our room, I think it might have something to do with giving the lovely Wes at reception a shot glass.
__label__very_positive	Great staff. Great Breakfast too!!!

__label__very_positive	WAY UNDERRATED I did a ton of back-and-forths over booking this hotel based on the reviews I read, but I was so glad I chose to stay here. Not only is it centrally located and a great bargain compared to the rest of NYC, I was so impressed with the friendly staff (especially given the stereo type of NY attitude...) I arrived at the hotel at 6 am, having taken a red-eye flight into the City, and I asked to stow my bags until check-in time. Without my asking, they offered to let me check into my room so, basically they gave me a full day free. I was so amazed. I had expected to be out in the snow drinking coffee until 3 pm. I love this hotel and would stay there again in an instant! The rooms are small, but I found it cozy due to the great decor.
__label__very_positive	Would stay again
__label__positive	Our agent booked this for us but initially we were a but miffed that it was a long way from the airport and main train station.

__label__neutral	We stayed here one night, the bed was VERY umcomfortable and somewhat itchy. It was really hot in the room when we first walked on which made the room have a weird smell to it. The TV was nice though....

__label__very_positive	This was our first - but not last - trip to Sicily and we really didn't know what to expect. We took the train from Rome to Palermo and then drove to Taormina and couldn't believe the views from our apartment (the hotel proper was closed). From snow topped Mt. Etna to our right, to the sea at our feet, it was truly breathtaking. Day excursions to Siracuse, Mt. Etna and Castlemola plus a day just wandering around town made for an unforgettable vacation. The views from Etna and Castlemola were simply breathtaking - as was the drive up narrow, winding roads! Another pleasant surprise was the quality of Sicilian wines. The luxury apartments of the Villa Carlota were first class is all respects. Simona and Riccardo were absolutely first class in making us feel at home and helping us with recommendations on dining and sightseeing trips. Could not ask for two better hosts. We will be going back, maybe next time to try the hotel.
__label__negative	Don't expect anything new or helpful staff. Room was clean but in need of updates. Ours was a non smoking with burns all one the comforter. Clean sheets and towels but room smelled and front door staff rude. The person cleaning our room was very helpful and nice so I did leave him a good tip and I hope he gets all of it. Room next door had holes on the door and stains all over. Phone didn't work very unpleasant and difficult to relax and sleep there. Will never stay again.
__label__very_positive	This hotel was very good for the price. Clean and new, excellent interior design and dcor. Breakfast was outstanding. Pool was nice but its not a very large pool, only 3' deep. Overall a very good stay.
__label__positive	"The Hotels.com post - and my confirmation email - said ""free wifi"". This was the deciding factor over a nearby hotel that appeared cheaper but charged $15 a day for wifi. Turns out wifi is free ONLY FOR KIMPTON REWARDS MEMBERS. And they mean it, and they stood by it when I checked out. Only the Hotels.com confirmation email, with the words ""free wifi"" in it, and my threat to write to Hotels about it, changed their minds. Anyway, beware. All that said... I love this hotel. Amazing neighborhood, great hotel restaurant and bar, and it's pretty reasonable for what you get."
__label__very_positive	Stay was awesome...the two queen beds room was very spaces with a microwave and mini fridge! Very clean and comfy bedding. Two blocks from canal and bourbon one of the best hotels to stay in if you want to be in the heart of NOLA. Being from Nola, I know a great new Orleans hotel when I experience. Btw...love the accent walls.
__label__very_positive	friendly staff, good breakfast, lots of parking space and very happy with our accommodation.
__label__neutral	comfortable stay - updated but bathroom tile work coming off the wall by tub
__label__positive	Got lost on the way there because of construction. Called ahead because a group of friends was already there and the room was under my name. The lady at the desk gave them a parking pass and let them go on to the convention we were in town for and we arrived later to a huge clean room. The access to the convention center was great and I will definitely be staying there again next year for the same convention.
__label__very_positive	We stay at this hotel a few times a year, and the service is great! On this recent visit, Liz from the SunSpot restaurant was so attentive and pleasant with our two young boys. We've also had the opportunity in the past to make pizza with Chef Haney, and the manager Kevin is always quick to respond to any questions.... More
__label__very_negative	house keeping is lazy
__label__neutral	I ended up not staying at the Super 8 in Metropolis. I had made the reservation with Expedia that was non-refundable nor changeable as I found out. It was not the hotel's fault at all, but I had asked for a handicapped accessable bathroom and I had two small dogs with me. Super 8 did not have that combination available in a room, it was either one or the other. This was not told to me until I was talking to the hotel. So I ended up staying somewhere else. This was neither a good deal nor was it something that I expected. I have learned to call the hotel first that I am wanting to book and ask questions before I lay my money out.

__label__neutral	We had to stop for the night just long enough to sleep and grab a shower, so we didn't want to spend a lot for a room. At first the front desk clerk was a bit rude, like we were making her work. Then when we checked-in, she was really nice. Our room was nothing special at all, but it... More

__label__positive	nice experience, breakfast the first day was questionable, but we tried the next day and was pleased.

__label__neutral	It was ok. The bed was comfortable but the breakfast wasn't all that great. The biscuits for the gravy were moldy and when i told someone they removed them but didn't replace it with anything.

__label__positive	This hotel is typical of Hampton Inns. I really like Hampton's beds and bedding, always clean and soft. The bathrooms are always clean, although this one had one minor maintenance problem which the front desk immediately called for repairs.

__label__very_positive	Christmas in Mexico was an interesting choice for our family but after arriving at the Pueblo Bonito Sunset Beach it was the right choice. It offered each family member an experience of a lifetime. The hotel was clean and beautiful. The staff was friendly and efficient. I am not sure if they added extra golf carts for the holiday but the longest we had to wait was 10 minutes. As far as being harassed by time share people we were fortunate enough not to be approached. Although we could not swim at the beach it still was a very clean beach and we enjoyed many hours there. Thank you for Christmas 2015.

__label__positive	The Hotel was nice. Convenient location to dining and Interstate. However I will not use Hotels.com again!!!!!! I specifically asked Hotels.com when I made the reservation to make absolutely sure I was able to have a roll away bed for our 12 year old son. Upon checking into the Hotel I was informed that per fire code a roll away bed could not be used in the room. I was forced to pay for another room for the extra bed that was needed.
__label__very_negative	The smoking odor was outrageous and even the non smoking room stunk. I will never stay here again and will not recommend.
__label__neutral	Not fancy but no complaints at all.
__label__very_positive	I have stayed multiple times because of the free breakfast (saves quite a bit of money) and the affordable rates. Book early and you can save a ton of money. I saved over 400 dollars booking 6 months out.
__label__very_positive	We stayed here during a road trip pass through. Hotel was nice, surrounding landscaping was great, breakfast had a variety but could have provided more- average. The bed was the most comfortable out of the ones we stayed at during our trip.

Our room and the hotel was well kept, clean and the decor tasteful.The 5 p.m. manager hosted wine tasting is an excellent way to return to the hotel after a nice day out to see the sites and touring. It was also a great ice breaker to meet other guests (or not).To top it off this particular property is perfectly located on King Street in historic Alexandria surrounded by shops and excellent choices of restaurants.We will definitely stay here again and will recommend to friends.

__label__positive	This is a great hotel! I love that it's not in the heart of UofA but not too far out of town either. I have stayed here several times. Rooms have been upgraded, but it looks like they saved costs by skimping out on new bathtubs. Not a big deal, just an observation. It's the only thing that's old in there.
__label__very_positive	Hotel was great. No complaints.
__label__very_positive	Overall very nice hotel and stay. Location is not perfect, outside the main areas to visit, but still fine. Outside pool fine, sufficient. Whirlpool is a nice plus, but the beach side and campfire very nice. Breakfast had great variety, just not enough seating. Pleasant surprice was the availability of drinks all day.
__label__negative	Do not expect good service
__label__very_positive	Lovely hotel, very good food, helpful friendly staff, stunning views over Florence. Only the less positive side the pool is a bit on the small side and soft drinks were very overpriced (5 each the same as most the alcoholic drinks)

__label__very_positive	The room was clean and exactly as I had reserved. The staff is friendly and extremely helpful. Very close to the airport, and the shuttle picked me up within minutes of calling the hotel front desk. Beautiful fitness center and outdoor pool. I would most certainly stay here again!
__label__negative	It's a dump. Tv didn't work, bugs uncomfy bed
__label__very_positive	I booked 5 rooms for 2 nights for a business trip. The hotel lost one of the room reservations and were completely sold out. This hotel took absolutely zero responsibility and did nothing to correct the situation but blame me for booking the reservation through my Booking.com Business account versus directly through them. The beds were comfortable
__label__very_positive	Recommended to those who are very fussy when it comes to hotel rooms. For the price of a normal hotel room, you are treated to a super luxurious suite. Facilities wise the gym is also impressive, but if you are going to use the pool you will be dissapointed by the size of the pool.

Bathrooms definitely show some wear but you can see that they are doing repairs to improve. Breakfast was simple (waffles, bagels, fruit) but we don't need more than that. Will stay here again if in the area.
__label__very_positive	Very relaxing
__label__neutral	The things that made this a true 4 star: Service was great & the hotel looked pretty. Things that made this more like a 2 star: Cleanliness regardless of how many times I complained was very poor (we found a glass under the bed and it looked like it was there for months); they did not replace essentials such as lotion etc.; and the bed gave me the worst back pain ever!

__label__very_positive	Located on the Lido I would recommend this hotel if you require a little piece and quiet after the busy day's in Venice, facility's good, staff very friendly and very helpful. I requested flowers for the room as it was one of my wife's special birthday's, and yes they ordered exactly as requested, can't ask for more. Rooms are a little on the small side but in line with most European hotels of this standard so wasn't a surprise or a problem, room and bathroom was cleaned every day with fresh towels supplied each day. Buffet breakfast had various options to suit most peoples taste but It was a surprise to see sausage, bacon and scrambled eggs available, must have been put on to satisfy us Brits! We stayed during late September so the Lido is probably quieter at that time however we felt very safe walking around late at night back to the hotel but taxis are available if you feel a little vulnerable. Restaurants and coffee bars are located in the main commercial area close to the Waterbus stations and tend to be slightly cheaper than in Venice. We had a water taxi (think luxury speed boat!) from the airport to the hotel and back again, quite an experience, a little costly but well worth it, a lot quicker and less hassle than the Waterbus. Venice was very busy during the day time, St Marks Square at night is a must, fantastic atmosphere. All in all we had a great time in Venice, it can be a little expensive so don't ponder over the bills to much, just pay up with a smile!

__label__positive	My husband and I loved this sweet little place. The staff was friendly, the room was so cute and cozy and we were close to everything we wanted to do. We had a balcony off our room that looked out on a courtyard which made us feel like we were in a treehouse and there was free, convenient parking. The only negative things were that the seagulls were crazy noisy outside and since this is an old building we heard them clearly and the bed was too firm for our liking.

The smell was everywhere! The ceiling looked as though it could cave at any time. The smell made us all nauseous gave us headaches. The room was clean, the beds okay. The location was great to hit Fremont street. We chose not to eat, gamble, or do anything in the building, but walk to from our room. Pretty sure we won't be staying there again.

__label__very_negative	1st night awakened by call from my cell phone, from a gentleman representing Quality Inn, stating that I had reserved a room and when was I coming to get it I explained already checked in. The phone number was a local area code, but was not hotel number. The front desk was baffled by who called 2nd morning, another guest used security card and was coming into our room! Found out, somehow, we had been checked out the day before, so we were not registered as guests. At that point, we checked out because we did not feel safe! We then proceeded to check into another hotel in area.

We asked for another room and they gave us an upgrade in another building. This room was much nicer, but we found out that the air wasn't working. The bathroom by the pool had no toilet paper and feces stuck on the toilet. This is probably the worst hotel we have ever stayed in. I know it is inexpensive but we had hoped for a clean, air conditioned room.

__label__negative	I booked a room at Quality Inn in Radford, Virginia. I left about an 1 after check in. Here is why: Lady in front of me was getting money back due to bed bugs. Once I got in the room, I immediately checked room and beds closely for bugs. Upon inspecting the sheets I discovered long hair in both beds on the pillows and in the sheets. One of the beds also had some sort of stain on the sheets. I went down to ask for clean sheets and the clerk after some hesitation said she would bring me new ones. I waited an hours and 15 minutes and nobody came. When I went back to the counter, there were now two clerks and there seemed to be a lot of confusion. While I was there, a lady came to the front counter and actually brought a bed bug that she found in her room. I asked for a refund and left. This place was disgusting and I think the corporate office should seriously question the management of this location. I am happy to explain all of my observations. I have stayed in a lot of rooms and do not consider myself fussy, but this place was pathetic and nasty.

__label__negative	The beds were clean and comfortable. We felt safe in our room, even though the window unit air conditioner was so loud you wouldn't have heard the door being knocked down. There was a small TV in the living room only. The couch was stained with what looked to be like bio hazard stains and the carpet was worn out and filthy. The bath room was clean and had a blow dryer. The floor of the elevator was soft and a little scary!

__label__neutral	We had a lovely stay, Location is great and staff especially friendly and helpful. Two tiny observations that might help them make everything even better. One, there were no towel rods near the sink, nowhere to put a handtowel. Also, unlike every hotel I've stayed in, there was no shower cap.Initially I was apprehensive a pet friendly hotel would show signs of pet hair, noise or other things a non-pet family might not tolerate. But the worse things I saw were some very cute dogs behaving extraordinarily well! Definitely not a problem.

__label__very_negative	If we weren't so tired and short on funds, we would have looked for another hotel!! Staff was unprofessional-from check in to asking the maid to move her cart so that we could pass on the narrow balcony to get to our room. Room was musty and old looking. There was an empty beer bottle in the trash can upon arrival, facial shaving remnants in the bathroom sink. The hotel was SO close to the freeway, that we got/had to hear 18 wheelers all through the night. Probably didn't help that there was a 1 inch gap under the door-first time to book on Expedia-not a good experience at all. Very disappointing. Would have expected better.

__label__positive	Everything was fine!
__label__neutral	Classy hotel with drag queens?!
__label__positive	SUCH AN AMAZING HOTEL!
__label__negative	The best thing about the hotel is the location. The room was clean but bathroom is in great need of refurbishing. The walls had black marks on them and need either a really good cleaning or fresh coat of paint. The shower tiles have been painted and the paint is peeling on the windowsill so you could see the original color. The staff was very friendly and it is an old hotel but okay if you just need a place to sleep and shower.
__label__very_negative	This was a terrible, awful hotel. The first room they put me in, the strike plate was missing on the door. The faucets were ancient, wrong for the sink, and they turned the wrong way. The spindle was missing on the toilet paper holder. Someone had left hairclips to hold the curtains together. And when I turned the sheets back, it was clear that they were not clean. I went back to the desk and found out that while I'd paid 50 for the room, it was a 30 room (this is a very cheap hotel). They put me in a 50 room, which was slightly better, but had a distinct, bad smell that stopped when I shut the A/C off. This is a terrible hotel. The only good thing about it is the two cats who live there.
__label__neutral	Hotel is in a pretty good location, handy to 91, Mass Pike, 6 flags, Springfield attractions etc. There is no restaurant/bar, but you can walk to IHOP and a short drive to Bertuccis, Olive Garden, Shopping...

__label__very_negative	The theme of our stay was absense. The clerk was absent from the front desk for twenty minutes while we waited to check in (and they did not answer our call from the lobby phone, as the note left behind ranked that we do). The hotel cleaning staff we absent. We left early in the day and came back at night. No one had even straightened up the bed or bring fresh towels. There wasn't even a trash bin in the bathroom. We just had to leave our garbage out. Other issues: A broken thermostat. Old mattress. Broken draining the tub (had to prop the drain open with a hanger). Although we had a non-smoking room, the rest of the place had a smoker's smell.

__label__very_negative	First of all, the front desk had a very unkept, shady atmosphere about it. I could smell cigarette smoke everywhere. The first room they offered me was one in which the front door did not bolt shut. The second room, bolted shut, but I was still leary since I could see the drill marks where this door had been repaired several times. The springs were shot in both beds, and they were not Queen Size as advertised. I saw a couple of roaches crawling in my kitchen. This hotel should not be listed in Expedia. It is a safety and health risk. The WiFi did not work.

__label__very_positive	Excellent hotel for a stay in Florence!
__label__positive	Recommendation great, will stay again if needed ride to airport! Prompt and friendly.
__label__very_positive	Even though the hotel is near the freeway, the room was quiet and comfortable. The bed was smaller than expected, and the air in the room was rather stale on entry. The check-in - check-out staff was very friendly. Will stay here again.
__label__positive	Highly recommend staying here

__label__negative	Wait times to check in were in excess of 40 minute on a Monday night around 10pm. Elevator took well over 10minutes to come to ground level and even longer to go to level 4. Credit card was hacked at front desk on the swipe because they do not use the newer chip technology. Received a call from chase and asked if i made several purchases the next morning and that is how i discovered the breech. Please start using the chip, such a stronger platform and helps prevent things like this. I'm not upset with the hotel for the hack, however measures should be taken to protect your customers.

__label__positive	We stayed here early February 2016 for our honeymoon. Overall our experience was fantastic. Spice was our favorite restaurant for dinner. Barcelona has an awesome breakfast buffet. The staff was always ready to take our order at all bars and servers on the beach visited often to make sure drinks were full. We stayed in a ocean view swim up pool excellence club room. We didn't use our outdoor bed and the pool as much as we thought only because the sun was gone by noonish, which was too bad. Our room did have a musty smell that I was unfortunately excited to leave by the 7th day so I would stay in an upper level ocean view next time. We will definitely go back!! The room just wasn't 100 worth the upgraded cost for the club and the swim up portion of it. We didn't utilize the excellence club as much as others might.. So probably wouldn't do that again either. Many daily activities. The shows at night were great, for the most part.. We were looking forward to the Michael Jackson show which they advertised was going to be happening the Thursday night we were there but they changed it to the following Thursday, out of our control but I was disappointed as we heard such great things about it. We met many people who were visiting for the second time so that was encouraging to hear. We also heard from many others in all their travels elsewhere similar, this was the best place! Which I could definitely understand. Everything is a short walk away from your room! I suggest a visit! :)

__label__neutral	I stayed here with a couple of girl friends, the hotel itself was nice, it is right off the free way though. The room was clean but smelled of smoke and when I asked them about it they told me the room we had was a previous smoking room. That was really the only thing that bothered us. Close to the casino which was nice!
__label__very_positive	very nice hotel in a great location. close to everything
__label__very_positive	Exceedingly Impressed
__label__neutral	The hotel was fine for the price and the staff was nice. The problem was I had a prepaid reservation/confirmation and the hotel routinely overbooks resulting no room available. Hotels.com refunded my price but I got stuck getting another room in a different hotel for twice the price. Talked to staff and this happens all the time. Hotel is allowing guests to extend stays even if already booked resulting in this problem. Reported to Hotels.com

__label__very_negative	One star because of the manager
__label__neutral	This hotel has had some of its rooms recently renovated. The building itself looks quite old, the elevator sounds and looks like it's about to fall apart. However the rooms inside are quite modern, neat, tidy. Basic but just what you need for an average priced stay near Lihue. Bed comfortable but some of the pillows had a slight dewy smell to them. Pool and jacuzzi nice. Restaurant small but good selection of meals and staff are very helpful in giving you suggestions of nearby eateries. One washing machine and dryer for the whole place was sometimes a nightmare (although it is free). Parking easy and free. WIFI signal too weak to be used on iPhones when we were in our room, weak signal can be picked up on a laptop. In the lobby the signal is strong and fast. The location of this hotel works well as you have easy access to the north and south. Overall a good comfortable stay, daily maid service was thorough. Hotel has good potential especially when they have finished renovations, established a concierge etc. would stay here again if visiting Kauai

__label__very_positive	Business Trip
__label__positive	We live an hour away and staying here one night allowed us to shop, eat and relax without having to rush home. Our room was large, clean and quite. The hotel seems brand new. The staff was nice. I just hate when there is no fan in the bathroom. I can't imagine the constant steam is a good thing. I read some reviews about the food so we decided to pay a little extra for the breakfast deal. It was not worth it in my opinion. Kids eat free which was nice but we still paid extra for what we needed and the taste was not great. The juices even had a bad plastic after taste. I would stay here again, I just wouldn't bother eating there.

__label__very_negative	We booked 3 suites. They didn't have the rooms we booked and paid for but it was midnight and we were tired so I said give us what you have. It took 45 minutes to get checked in and while we were waiting a guy comes in throws his keys on the counter and says we aren't staying hhere there is blood stains on the sheets then turns to us and says if you are about to stay here do yourselves a favor and go somewhere else. I thought maybe he was extra picky and exaggerating the situation but I was wrong he was right. The rooms were upstairs, the first step to go upstairs was broken up concrete with the re bar showing and bent down to the ground so you had to skip it and start with the second step. All 3 rooms were dirty, half of the lights didn't work the floor was weak in places, there were stains on the sheets and comforters and hair in the a couple beds (some human some dog). Questionable activity in the parking lot possibly drug dealers and or user's. We went back to the counter and told the man that we were sorry but all 3 rooms were unacceptable and we were going to try to find somewhere else to stay he said ok he understood and gave me a print out showing we didn't stay. The next day I contacted hotels.com and asked to get our money back and they said the hotel had a hold on it and they called to get the hold released but the hotel wouldn't release it. I went to the hotel to find out why and a guy claiming to be the owner wouldn't cooperate I was very polite and patient and he started good but quickly got rude and said it's not his fault we chose to leave and he would not release the hold. After trying to reason with him for a little while he said at that point we were trespassing and called the authorities. After about 15 minutes no one showed up and so I called the authorities to see what my options were and they said it was a civil dispute and suggested I contact the hotels corporate office. All I was able to do is leave corporate a message and have still not r

__label__positive	I was in a nonsmoking room, and the room itself was free of odor. The hallway had a distinctly off odor, clearly not smoke free. The room and bathroom seemed basically clean. However, the curtain was visibly stained. The cleaning crew did not clean the toilet the first day (it clogged, and still was when I returned in the evening). The capstone I got to watch a large, many legged bug 1.5 long scurry across the bathroom floor and out of sight. I then discovered another similar one behind the shower curtain on the floor dead next to the tub.

__label__positive	Nice two day stay. Hotel was good. I thought my price was pretty good. Area is good. Travel to surrounding areas is easy and quick. Only downside was bedspread looked like stain on it.
__label__neutral	So so
__label__neutral	Nette kleine Zimmer, die jedoch nicht grndlich sauber gemacht wurden(nicht staubgesaugt und grndlich gewischt). Gerne wurde auch das Fenster von der Putzfrau offen gelassen, wo andere 2 Zimmer mit Terrassenzugang mhelos reinspazieren konnten. Ein absolutes No-Go. Leider waren die Zimmer nicht klimatisiert... Von daher lieber nicht an heien Tagen dort bernachten. Personal ging auerdem auf alle Wnsche ein und war hilfsbereit. Die Anbindung der Ubahn war meiner Meinung richtig gut. Die nchste Station war 2min entfernt und man konnte in 2min zur Station Nation kommen, wo man quasi berall hin konnte in 15-25min.
__label__positive	Cold showers two mornings in a row:(
__label__positive	Staff was very nice and helpful. Breakfast was okay. I'm GF so I just had yogurt and a banana but they had some good options. Rooms have been partially remodeled. New beds, bed linens and furniture (including tv). The bed was EXTREMELY comfortable. Bathrooms are still old fixtures but were clean. No blow dryers in rooms ladies. Only soap and shampoo dispensers, no individual bottles. Bottom line, for about 60 it was a good value. You're not getting nicer ammenities but your not paying for them either. If you need a quick overnight stay, it's a good option.

__label__positive	Our room was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. We had a family member in the hospital nearby. Close to the interstate.
__label__very_negative	Nothing as such. The city is in a bad shape and the pollution and dirt doesnot allow you to roam much but the resort was fantastic. Swimming Pool and Jogging Track was a delight. Casino Pride was also amazing.

__label__very_positive	Great Hotel
__label__negative	We had to change 3 rooms until we get a clean room. First room had personal itens as a dirty boot and unbrealla on the floor, second room a really bad smell of cigarrete, third room was acceptable, 30 min for this process. As the whole city was fully booked, no option to find another place...at least the staff on the front desk was helpfull..
__label__very_negative	Very dirty room. The cleaning was not close to normal standards. To their credit I called the manager upstairs to show him and he did credit us one night back on our credit card. So his handling of the situation was professional but nonetheless i cannot recommend this hotel. Would have been more comfortable in a motel 6.

__label__very_positive	My wife, 2 dogs and I were evacuated from our home on Hilton Head Island due to Hurricane Matthew. Our initial reservation was for 3 nights but needed to stay additional nights because we were not allowed back to HHI due to storm damage. The first desk clerk (Name) was not friendly or helpful. The day desk clerk Crystal was so helpful and accommodating and worked with us each day to extend our stay, even finding us another room because our first one was booked. She could not have been nicer. This was our first stay at a Holiday Inn Express but Crystal made us want to stay at them in the future.

__label__positive	That staff was great... I thought the AC could have been little better. The location is closed to great shopping opportunity and a few good BBQ restaurants...
__label__neutral	The free parking in Boston is a huge plus but the lack of delivering enough parking spaces was a problem. They offered additional parking across the street in an abandoned poorly lit parking lot which was frequented by bums who called it home.

__label__very_negative	When we arrived the girl at the front desk could not find my reservation. Then when she did she only checked me in for one of my two rooms and had to go back and find my second room. Then she had me sign the Hotels.com (Expedia) receipt, showing me their price for the room. The hotel and the room itself were older but the room was large. The beds however were very unstable and rocked or bounced from side to side. My wife also found a few black beetles in her bed. It served its purpose as a place to stay for the night but I would not recommend this hotel if you have another choice.
__label__positive	if you don't like the food down stairs they always have burgers that they will cook to order just ask. it takes about 10-15 minutes though
__label__very_negative	never again
__label__very_positive	The only problem is that the hotel and everything on King street is very expensive.
__label__positive	We stayed 2 nights and loved the room it was beautiful the whole hotel was. The hotel staff was helpful and nice the biggest problem we had was parking you have to park on the street there is a parking lot in the back but if you're handicapped then it makes it very hard on you.

__label__very_negative	I am highly disappointed by the staff and the manager. I and my daughter spent one night at this hotel and found a dirty pair of men's underwear in the room. Thinking it was something of ours she picked it up. I went to the office and told the manager and she seemed to have no care. I called hotel.com and they called the hotel to confirm everything and he came back on the phone said yes, they don't seem to care hotel.com gave us a 25.00 gift card.

__label__very_positive	Third time my husband and I have slept here. It's a very clean hotel that is great for cost and has a free shuttle. We come for the Xfinity music center annually. Never had a problem. Staff is polite and place is clean. Bed is soft and the shower pressure is perfect (strange but true) Breakfast is free and basic bagels egg waffles with juice/coffee.
__label__very_positive	It was a great stay. I would like to say I am really happy that they are a pet friendly hotel. More hotels need to be pet friendly. Thank you for the great stay!
__label__positive	Personnel parfait
__label__negative	The beds felt like sleeping on a pile of winter coats - not 4 star hotel beds in my experience. There was a large smashed dried jalapeno on the floor which led me to question if the floors were even vacuumed or they just missed a giant piece of jalapeno on the floor. Smell was acceptable.
__label__positive	Great for visiting area, shopping center, gas, etc all right across the street. Very nice room, especially for the price.

__label__very_negative	Dirty, rotting bathroom wall, bugs in the shower, Not just the occasional spider, no it had Ear Wigs. There was a trash bag taped over the fire alarm/ sprinkler. I'm an active reviewer and I can always find something nice to say about a place. but this place was bad bad bad.
__label__very_negative	The hotel facility is old and there is a bad smell in the room
__label__very_positive	I stay at this hotel several times a year and often request the same room. since my last stay in November, 2015, the room has been repainted and also new carpet, furniture beds. A great place for the business traveler but also many families on the weekends.
__label__positive	hotel ok but there was a few things
__label__very_positive	Pet friendly! Dog fee $25 :(
__label__neutral	We treated ourselves for our honeymoon and booked a lake view balcony room at this hotel (because it was one of the few hotels walking distance from a friend's wedding). Unfortunately when we arrived we were informed that not only was our dream room not available, but no rooms were available, except for a dark back room overlooking a carpark. We had booked 3 months in advance and paid in full, but were informed that there had been been a double booking and were placed in a sister hotel in a neighbouring town (same manager). We were given various excuses....the weather had caused water damage to some rooms and the computer system was down (so bookings not completed directly with the hotel were not recognised). Only after raising our concerns about how we would get to and from the wedding (as we had planned to walk the short distance home after the wedding late at night) did the hotel offer us taxis. No taxis were available, so we walked the long distance to the second hotel...in the rain. The narrow roads don't have footpaths, so when cars came racing past we took our lives into our own hands, which resulted in an injury. If we had been able to stay in the hotel we had booked, this would have been avoided. On a positive note, the hotel is in a beautiful location and the manager offered for us to go on a couple of tours (paid by the hotel) and have some complimentary meals.
__label__very_positive	great stay!!
__label__very_negative	The only clean thing about this hotel was the check in. We paid (with tax) 155.00 for the room with 3 beds due to the fact we have older kids and they refuse to sleep in the same bed (no biggie) when we got to our room for the night and turned down the bed the cover had several hairs in-bedded in the cover, the sheets had several cigarette burn holes in it. So needless to say NO ONE slept in the 3rd bed. There was a dead bug under the counter that the coffee maker was on (coffee and no cups) the outlet by the coffee maker when we went to plug in the straighter it would just fall out, the outlet behind the nightstand was literally hanging out of the wall. The little doily that I'm assuming should have been on the table under the phone was behind the table and on the floor, I'm sure was there for some time...I totally understand a quick cheap place to stay but, when you are up all night worrying about if the place is going to burn down!! NO THANKS! I'm glad our room was at the end of the hall by the EXIT door. You will not find my family there. I did speak to a manager (I'm assuming since he said he could hear out my issues) and he gave me a whopping 20 off so instead of 155 I am paying 124.00 not satisfied and will not return. Who pays even 124.00 to stay in a place like this!! HJ 1 myself 0..I lost on this bad decision making. I wish I could get the picture to upload. I forgot about the stains on the comforter (the same bed that had hair and cigarette burns on it.

__label__neutral	"Our room was adequate except for the burn marks in the sink, poor tile work in the bathroom, and a malfunctioning heating/cooling unit. The unit made odd snapping noises periodically, had to be set on the lowest setting to not overheat the room (58 degree setting made it about 70). The unit leaked water onto the carpet and showed signs of having been ""patched"" with aluminum foil."

The hotel was nice and close to the things we were involved in, but I am not sure we will be back at this particular motel.

__label__neutral	Almost rated it very good
__label__neutral	The beds had bedbugs. I itched all night.
__label__negative	The hotel is RIGHT next to highway (I-90). Heard traffic zooming by all night. The bed wasn't very comfortable, felt the springs. Bathroom was SO small, barely enough room to close the door while you were in it.
__label__very_negative	Do not take the last available room, the staff probably did what they could with what they had. The entire place should be taken down and start over. Location is really great. There are few motels in Whitehall for Summer time, probably plenty for the winter. A hotel with a moderate priced restaurant attached, would be great however, this place should be removed. It reflects Whitehall in a very negative way!

When we walked in there was 1 hand towel laying on a bed and that was it. No towels. Window didnt open air conditioner did not work and it was 90 degrees outside. Bathtub had scum all over it bathroom floor had mold in corner. Mirrors had smudges and fingersl smears all over it. It was a horible stay just nasty. The carpet had spots that my socks stuck to because it was so sticky. No ice bucket just garbage bags. Wasnts worth the 90 dollars i woulda rather stayed at homeless shelter

__label__negative	walked in the room and smelled gas. the oven pilot was lite with no flames. killed 4 cockroaches on the way back to the door. went to the front desk and told them the gas was on and that i killed 4 cockroaches for them but would to turn on the AC so the whole hotel would not blow up. 15 minutes later a man knocked at the door saying he was with pest control, i gladly let him in and stepped outside. He left and an hour later i decided to turn the oven on to fix my dinner, a mouse ran out from under the oven and into a hole near the baseboard of the kitchen. I packed up and called another hotel and checked out within 2 hours upon arrival. the next day while at work i looked down and a roach was crawling on my uniform. on the way home while driving a roach crawled out of my AC duct. Guess they were not happy with their last place of residence either and decided to travel along with me. Need i say they met with unfortunate disaster which resulted in their death.
__label__very_positive	We really enjoyed the Rose room. The breakfasts were awesome, Bill and Beverly were great. It was a great getaway and one we'll do again. Why stay in a hotel when you can have this wonderful experience. We'll do it again for sure! Ron and Sue

__label__negative	We stayed 1 night at this hotel and were happy to leave. We were 2 women travelling alone and the hotel (motel) had only outside room entrances. The door didn't seem very secure and as we were unloading the car, a man (obviously high on something) approached and asked if he could help. This made us very uncomfortable and concerned that he might return. The walls were paper thin and the beds were not comfortable. The bathroom had some hair on the floor and it did not feel clean. The only bright side of the experience was the breakfast which included a waffle maker and coffee.

__label__very_positive	I stayed 3 nights with my son (17 years old) while visiting my best friend. The hotel was clean, the room was clean and it was exceptionally quiet. Coming from NYC I actually enjoy the quiet. Its close to almost everything and directly across the street from then mall which was a plus for me.

__label__positive	Me and my boyfriend stayed at this hotel for two nights. I was hesitant at first from reading previous reviews.. but we had a delightful stay! We had a king size bed which was very comfortable. No issues checking in since we are 19. The room was clean, we got sick during our stay and threw up all over the bed and floor and room service had no problems cleaning everything up. Good distance from the beach.. not that close but a few blocks down. I would definitely stay here again.

__label__very_positive	The hotel and staff were fine. The walk to restaurants, etc. was a little dicey, requiring a walk totally around hotel (in dark) to highway, then crossing to get to eateries. There were ramshackle wire fences cutting us off from a direct walk to cross highway.

They also enjoyed the large open area near the river. The room was quiet and clean. The staff were courteous and polite. Highly recommended if staying in the Bay City area.
__label__very_negative	We had to walk through the facility with employee to find a CLEAN room. 5 different rooms before we found a clean one. The drawers were broken, the pillowcases were yellow and there was mold on the ceiling in the bathroom. This place is not worth the time or money. The only worth talking about at this place is was...

__label__neutral	Almost Home
__label__positive	I was very comfortable and enjoyed the stay with the exception of check out time. I verified several times that check out was 11am. The housekeeping crew started pestering me around 10:20am. They hung out at my door the whole time I was trying to pack up and get ready to leave. The male even stepped very close to me asking if they could get into the room. I was very clear and said no. I will be out by 11am. I felt so pressed that I finally relented, thru all my belongings out the door and finished packing out in the parking lot. Needless to say I won't be staying there again. Other that the housekeeping pushing me out the door it was a nice stay. (I did complain at the front desk)
__label__negative	Not Bad-We gave a try and will return
__label__neutral	I arrived after midnight and very tired from driving. The room was a second level townhouse-no elevator. My back was killing me-no parking near my townhouse -the lot was all full and I had to park at the other end by entrance. Being on my own -I would have rather had an inside entrance to my room and an elevator. The AC worked fine but the bathroom was not clean -hair in tub. Overall you could see it was an older place that had been updated. I would not stay there again. Staff was good.
__label__positive	Jean was the sweetest! I will definitely go back.
__label__very_positive	I attend the local dog shows twice per year in this area. I stay at this La Quinta each time I need to spend the night for the dog show. It is conveniently located by I-65 and I enjoy the free breakfast allowing me extra time to get ready so I don't have to rush off and find breakfast somewhere. I also love the indoor pool so I can swim even in nasty weather, and adore having the hot tub to relax after a long day running in the ring with my dogs.
__label__very_positive	Affordable and Accommodating!
__label__positive	Cet tablissement est un havre de paix. Il est entour d'un parc superbe et est long par la Gironde, paisible estuaire de la Garonne.

J'ajoute que le restaurant est dlicieux et d'un excellent rapport qualit/prix.

__label__neutral	Good location, below average service, food and amenities
__label__very_positive	I visited this hotel with my wife and 2 kids and we loved it! Food was great and the drinks were awesome! Very clean hotel and I would recommend visiting this hotel. Only thing is that you can walk around the resort easily due to steep hills, but there are plenty of golf carts w/drivers getting you around the entire resort which is HUGE fyi. My wife got sick 1 day but cant really say if was from the hotel food since we had gone into town to try the local food. Cannot go into the ocean at this resort but you can at their sister hotel Pueblo Bonito Rose, we went 1 day but the ocean is really rough and not good for little kids. My older daughter and I did swim in the ocean but it wasn't easy. I would visit this hotel again in the future. Please get a shuttle included in the package deal, they charge 80 each way to hotel/airport if you pay when you get to the airport.
__label__very_negative	This place is more like a Section 8 apartment complex than a hotel. People live here. That means they collect their mail here on a regular basis. It was the worst hotel room and hotel I've ever seen.

__label__neutral	Actually, we were relieved to find the room pretty decent considering it is only one of the 2 or 3 hotels/motels in Charlestown.

__label__very_negative	Unfortunately, my stay was not pleasant. While checking in I was asked for 50 additional deposit for incidentals this was a first for me (considering furniture was dusty from renovations). Also, I didn't read about the charge under hotel details (pets, rollaways, extra parking) but not incidentals. Next, once in room i noticed my tv was slanted on the wall. Also, I had no hot water in shower ( I left running to try and get hot) never did. Next, ice machine was empty. Finally, I was awakened to loud banging like with tools and heavy walking above my room quite early.
__label__neutral	I smell smoke

__label__very_positive	Stayed at the Octagon Inn last weekend, what a great place. You couldnt ask for a better location and the place was so clean! I especially enjoyed relaxing on the front deck each evening, watching the sun set against the spectular rimrock background. If you are looking for a reasonably priced place to kick back after a long day fighting trout on the San Juan, you simply cant beat the Octagon Inn. I'm hooked!
__label__neutral	I've stayed a number of times for business and enjoyed my stay. However, during my most recent stay the A/C wasnt working so I called for service...no one ever showed up and finally at 10pm with a meeting in the morning I went to bed- uncomforatble! Very dissapointed!
__label__positive	Spacious rooms
__label__very_negative	Fasely advertised by the pictures from the Internet versus real life. Scarey looking at first sight looks abandoned.
__label__positive	Clean well kept property, currently undergoing renovations, friendly staff, good hot breakfast buffet and reasonable price. What more could we ask for. Pool was busy with kids on the weekend but its adults only after 10 pm. Vehicular access was a little unusual but fairly easy once you've been there once.
__label__very_positive	Facilities were clean and inviting. Great for the price.
__label__negative	The bathroom tub constantly leaked water. We called to desk service for extra pillows and at two separate times after ten pm. We got knocks at our door for extra towels. One set of towels given to us had a pile of dirt on it. We also noticed that our facilitator never worked at all.

__label__negative	Hotel room showed some age, but was clean. Breakfast was OK but nothing out of the ordinary. Service was poor and unresponsive. Stayed 2 nights. The first night there was a high school soccer team staying overnight and the second night a college volleyball team. Although the hotel was quite busy both of these teams were not the problem, but rather other quests who were wandering the halls, banging doors, yelling, cursing and generally acting obnoxiously. Didn't say anything the first night but tried to call the front desk the second night at 2:30am and could get no one to answer. Stayed on the third floor so was not about to personally go to the desk. When I checked out at around 8:50 am had to wait 10 minutes before anyone came from the back office and then got and OK, thanks for a farewell. At that point didn't bother trying to speak with anyone. Would not stay here again.

__label__very_positive	We were in town for a wedding and wanted to spend some extra time in the area to do some sightseeing around the Capitol. This hotel was perfect, close to all kinds of dining options, many little shops to browse through, walking distance to the river and a free Trolley car to get easily to the Metro station. The staff was always very friendly and helpful. I would go back and stay here again.

The hotel served a full hot breakfast but some items were not hot. The most outstanding quality of the hotel was the hospitality of the staff. We were greeted warmly. The front desk person actually remembered us from our last visit. We would definitely stay here again in spite of the few short comings.

__label__very_positive	Perfect choice. Great addition of the new restaurant next door
__label__positive	Good: bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept it! Bad: Valet service was terrible when entering. Not enough attendendants at peek times. Attendendants didn't want to direct traffic if it entailed getting in the sun to eplain where entering cars had to go. They preferred to to stay under the canopy and the entering guess we're left unattended in the drive. Poor service there. Enter for check in and line was long, that's expected. But only 6 agents to handle the crowd is why there was a back up. IP is a nice place. Great pool area. Resort fees for a hotel in Mississippi(it's just a hotel in Mississippi) I was there for a concert, the room was prepaid. Then the hotel changed the date of the concert and charged me more to change the date of my stay. That I'd say was poor judgment on their part. I explained when changing the reservation that it was IP's fault that the dates changed. That didn't matter to them. They gladly charged me another 33 dollars per night. Plus resort fees. Fool me once.

__label__very_positive	Typical of a Four Seasons, this place is awesome. The rooms are new and huge, with amazing views of the Arch or river. This is the best deal you are going to get at this high end hotel chain and it's well worth it. I recommend parking at the casino next door and taking the elevator down to the lobby.
__label__very_positive	Very friendly staff, quiet location,clean moderne building, housekeeping was very helpful, free parking. The only down side is the parking below ground is too small for all guests, confusing and once up their garage elevator- you go up a floor, walk to other side of hotel to get in on another elevator

__label__positive	Overall we had a very nice stay here. The rooms were clean, quiet and the beds were very comfortable. The breakfasts are very well organized and you lack for nothing. Staff were helpful and the location was fantastic. For families it is a very good choice. Only downside is that the pool, which was warm and inviting, but was CLOSED! Very frustrating for us as we thought it was perfect swimming weather yet they had no plans on opening the pools for at least another month. Don't bother bringing your bathing suit out of the summer season without checking the pool open dates or you will be as disappointed as us.
__label__very_positive	Comfortable Stay
__label__neutral	The first night I was there, hotel staff slid a note under the door at 9:30 that evening letting us know that they would be coming into the room the next morning at 9:00 am to do some sort of construction, and they would come in even if we had the Do Not Disturb sign up. Nothing was said to us when we checked in earlier that day at 3:00 pm, which would have been a nice warning. The way they let us know was extremely unprofessional and rude.
__label__very_positive	This is a nice clean hotel. It has upscale features, like a luggage cart. Great urban features in a small town feeling hotel. I wish that there was water (hot or cold) available in the breakfast room later in the day.
__label__very_positive	Top notch!
__label__very_positive	We've stayed at this property before to enjoy the spacious rooms and incredible views. This year the resort has upped their game.

This is a great place to really relax or... More
__label__positive	Good motel and a great location downtown. Rooms were good and clean. Courtyard was a nice and quiet inspite of being in town. Beds were comfortable but small. I think they were smaller than a queen.
__label__positive	The hotel is large and set in extensive grounds in a perfect location for exploring the left bank. The room was very large and comfortable but the air conditioning didn't work very well. Some of the main through areas looked a little tired and in need of some attention. We made use of the Spa and the inside and outside pools and they were clean and the water was a good temperature. The staff in the restaurant were excellent - Jerome in particular. The food was very good value and beautifully presented. Overall good value for money and I would stay here again.
__label__neutral	The room didn't seem to have been swept. There were dead bugs in the kitchen area floor and hair in the bathroom. Also, the lights went out around 9:30 AM on Sunday. Luckily the sun was out giving the room some light. I was a bit disappointed with my stay at this Extended Stay.
__label__negative	Hotel needs some maintenance.
__label__very_positive	Great trip!
__label__neutral	Good stay if you want to be centralized to the sights of Seattle, good restaurants, bus routes and grocery store and you don't mind modest accommodation.
__label__very_negative	Hotel was fine for the price and based on the reasons I needed the hotel for that week we stayed there. However it was old/aged. There were signs of disrepair in the hotel room as well as steps leading up to the hotel room (motel style). The metal stairs leading up to the second floor had loose/wobbly steps. The room smelled also like marijuana.
__label__positive	Almost perfect (no A/C!) Stay here when cooler.
__label__very_positive	Most comfortable bed!
__label__positive	I very nice hotel for the business traveler. Free WiFi with a desk in the room. The size of the room was comfortable, functional and very clean.

Fresh fruit in the form of an apple, pear and orange. I would stay there again

__label__very_positive	nice
__label__very_positive	This is not typically one of the brands I consider, but was one of the recommended options from a client, so I decided to give it a try. The access to the highway is great, but strangely enough the road noise wasn't a problem. The check-in process was very easy and the room was comfortable. The elevator is a little slow and there was a odd humming noise in the hallways (not enough to notice in the room). The breakfast offers many options and I was pleasantly surprised by the friendliness of the staff - not only happy but genuine and interactive. I did have an issue connecting a Mac laptop to their WiFi, and despite talking with tech support, was unable to get it to work. All other devices connected fine (3 Windows, 2 Androids).
__label__very_positive	We go back again and again!
__label__very_positive	Quaint and Cozy B & B near the Beach and Town
__label__very_negative	Ask for the renovated rooms facing times square... Old side is a $h1t hole!
__label__negative	This is not really a hotel! Most of the rooms are in separate buildings from the reception area and access to the rooms is outdoors. The breakfast is OK but again the breakfast is located in a separate building which is not signposted at all. Although the hotel claims to have Wifi in the rooms there is none. Wifi is only available in the reception area. There is a bar but it is not staffed and ordering a drink is only possible if there is no function on in the adjoining wedding centre.
__label__negative	The hotel is no where near a 4.4 star rating. The staff was friendly and the room was clean, but this hotel was very outdated and it wasn't family friendly. There was people smoking at the swimming pool which was horrible for us. I couldn't believe that a Hampton Inn didn't have a closet, but a curtain with hooks behind it! Overall if you're looking for a nice getaway don't go here. But if you're just looking for somewhere to stay for a night it's not bad

Every hour was very noisy from the upstairs rooms and the traffic along the upstairs and downstairs corridors. The children got out of hand they were running around unsupervised and were very noisy after 10pm. The continental breakfast was horrible! The utensils' and cups where dirty. The juice and milk were watered down. The coffee was never refilled. The cereal bread and bagels were all stale. The creamers where spoiled. No one was available at any time.

__label__neutral	We needed a place to stay for the night while passing through Las Vegas. We wanted a hotel that was close to I-15 and inexpensive but clean. The Plaza Hotel was inexpensive and relatively clean and quiet but a little musty. It was nice that it was located very close to Freemont Street so we had an opportunity to experience Freemont Street without much effort. The front desk staff were nice and attentive. If we were passing through Las Vegas again and needed a place to crash for the night I would stay at this hotel again.

__label__negative	From the looks of the outside, I thought this would be a good choice. The check in staff was very friendly. When we got to our room the tv was on. Which was weird. We stayed 2 nights, so housekeeping came by, took our towels, but didn't leave any new ones. And again left the tv on. We were on the second floor, which is right below the lobby. So there was a lot of noise throughout the entire night. But... the staff was nice...

__label__very_negative	I booked two rooms at this hotel for two nights. The hotel doesn't have many stores or food places nearby. When we got inside the rooms we were very displeased. Everything appeared dirty most noticeable in the bathrooms, there was hair around the tub and the inside of the tub had a brownish grey appearance (supposed to be white). It was the same in both bathrooms. The tiles in the bathroom were dirty and definitely appeared like they were not cleaned. The toilet had a grey dirt ring around the inside of both. They offered free breakfast, but based upon he appearance of the room we opted out. In walking down the walk path past the other rooms, dirty curtains could be seen in each window we passed. The pool looked cloudy, so my children didn't have the option swimming either.

The pool area was clean and quiet and the hotel was quiet as well which i enjoyed. And if you put the do not disturb sign on the door they do respect your wishes till you take it down and then they will clean your room.
__label__very_positive	Just back from a wonderful two night stay at the Merritt House Inn in Monterey, Ca. When my granddaughter and I arrived, we were told that we could have our room up-graded from a one bed to a two bed room for the same price. We were given a choice of floors also. The room was clean and very spacious. We also enjoyed the daily breakfast in the common room. It is billed as a continental breakfast but is actually more than that considering that hard-boiled eggs, cereal, muffins, bagels, fruits and beverages are included. The gardens are very attractive and well kept. We had a great stay with the gracious staff and I would certainly return.

__label__positive	I really liked this hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean. The bathroom was especially clean. I get grossed out easily and nothing here grossed me out (I didn't even wear my flip flops in the shower). We ended up staying in two different Drury Inns over the weekend. This was our choice as the hot tub was out of order in the first hotel and we really wanted to spend the evening in a hot tub. The first night we stayed at the Drury Inn in Grove City which was a 10-15 minute drive. That hotel was recently remodeled, so the rooms there were fresh looking and had a new feel to them. The Drury Inn downtown had the same great layout, but was just older. Both places had free popcorn and soda, a free happy hour (get the wine), and served free food throughout the day, which helps you save a little on food during your stay.

__label__positive	The hotel was great. It was clean, the breakfast was nice and the staff was friendly and accommodating. I would definitely stay there again.

__label__neutral	I recently had lunch at Lobby at 12, and I have to say I really don't have anything negative to say about my experience. I had a wood grill pizza, and I loved it and would definately order one again. The atmosphere is very classy casual, but yet they treat you like you're in an upscale fancy restaurant. Prices are quite fair, they're set at a good inbetween range not too expensive and not too cheap. I think this place is especially great for business lunches when you're looking for a nice place to entertain a client, but don't want anything too upscale and foo foo. Lobby has a clean atmosphere, good service, tasty food, and everything is just very classy and sophisticated. I really enjoyed.

There were outlets on the lamp on the desk on other side of the room, but had to utilize them for other (work) devices. Room was spacious, more spacious than other Holiday Inn's and was clean comfortable. Only had time for breakfast once (here working) and only had the scrambled eggs. Taste and consistency was fine. All the staff interacted with was pleasant and helpful.

__label__positive	Staff was VERY friendly and accommodating. They arranged for a bike delivery and pickup and allowed us to check in early. The hotel is very modern and clean. We had a view of the harbor on the 4th floor. Towels and fresh coffee cups were delivered every day. The room had a two cup coffee maker, which was very convenient. Everything about this room was as advertised. The pool/hot tub area were clean and easy to get to. The fitness center has modern workout equipment. This hotel was definitely worth the price of admission. Take a harbor view if you want to view the harbor, the Coronado Bridge and the Pt. Loma. Take the Marina view if you want to see the boats, the planes taking off from the airport and the sunset.
__label__very_positive	Nice Standard Hotel
__label__very_positive	It was very close to JRB Fort Worth, and close to a lot of other things to include restaurants and shops.

__label__positive	My biggest issue was that the dryer was broken. The sweet woman at the front desk said they could dry my stuff for me if I had one load and could get it to her by a certain time. I just ended up driving 10 minutes away to a laundromat.
__label__very_negative	I brought my wife and two young children for an Easter weekend getaway. I was not aware that a block of rooms nearby were taken by a group that wanted to get drunk and party all night. We tried to ignore the noise but after midnight, my wife asked the group to keep the noise down. They got louder. After two more tries, we contacted the front desk. The night manager stopped by for about a minute asking the group to quiet down. As soon as he left, the drunken mob was angry at us and started slamming into our door. When my wife opened the door to complain, they started to push her around. As soon as I stepped out of the door to help my wife, I was beaten by this drunken mob as my children in the room were terrified. My eye glasses were punched into my face causing me to bleed profusely. I was beaten and kicked as I lay on the hallway floor. My wife also has bruises all over her body. A couple across the hall called the police, but the damage was already done. When the police arrived, the attackers scattered. Some were in rooms on our floor while others were not even guests of the hotel. There are no cameras, no security and a night manager who would rather not get involved. The management told me that there was nothing that they can do because they have no way of knowing who was at fault. Unbelievable. My face is cut up, my wife is bruised and my children are traumatized. Good place if you want to party all night long. Bad place to bring a family. Bottom line the Bayside Resort Hotel was the worst hotel experience of my life.
__label__positive	Great stay for the price. The breakfast was good- pretty standard fare. I would recommend if you are someone who doesn't need the latest of everything- just a place to stay and shower that is clean and safe.
__label__very_positive	The staff here is the best part. They are so helpful and cheery. The breakfast was wonderful, i wish I had the stomach to eat everything that was offered. Great stay! Upstairs can be a bit noisy, heard footsteps all night. Also, the bathtub's anti-slip strips have worn away, so the bathtub was quite a bit scary slippery....
__label__very_negative	This hotel needs serious upgrades to its rooms. The mattress set on the bed was uneven. The TV wasn't even a flat screen TV. The hotel is NOT secure. The exterior doors to the hotel are unlocked and anybody can walk in to the hotel.
__label__very_positive	Robert at the front desk was very friendly and accommodating. Great location, excellent good choices for breakfast. The breakfast staff was also very friendly and made sure all items were continually stocked for breakfast.
__label__positive	A 4 star rating tells you that a hotel has a keen eye for details and unexpected pleasures and smiles are expected. That is not this hotel. I booked because of experience with Kimpton hotels in other cities. This one does not meet the Kimpton standard. Examples: Showerhead that stays in one position (straight down because of faulty bracket), toilet that runs and hums long after the flush (don't think that's a feature), a totally dysfunctional internet, which they acknowledge was on the blink. Overall, the hotel just needs some management attention and it could easily be brought up to standard 4 star. It is not at the moment a 4 star.

__label__positive	Our room was excellent. It was very clean, and the beds were very comfortable. The public areas of the hotel could use a little sprucing up--some new carpet in the hallways, new chairs in the restaurant, etc. No free breakfast, but we had a good dinner in the lounge on Sunday night and a good breakfast in the restaurant on Monday morning. The outside of the building looks a little dingy. The wallpaper next to the table where we sat for breakfast had grease stains on it.

__label__negative	This hotel was definetley not a place I would recommend to anyone or stay at again. They have a 60 swing in room prices and when asking the front desk agent what a normal price was without booking through a third party she told me she didn't know and didn't have access to that information. Something seemed fishy when I paid 60 more a night then another guest. Never again!
__label__very_positive	Trip
__label__very_positive	programmable thermostat
__label__neutral	Accessible room was a bit of a disappointment. The most important item needed was a comfort height toilet. The toilet was extremely low (probably not more than 15 high) and very difficult to use for someone with hip and knee problems. There was a grab bar, which was absolutely needed. There were brown water stains around the base of the toilet which gave the bathroom a very bad look. In addition there was a very glaring light in the bathroom and no place for a night light. Also did not like the fact that the room was in the back of the hotel in a separate building. Usually accessible rooms are located in the front of the hotel on the ground level. There was a bag of trash by the door where we entered our building and it was still there when we checked out the next day.

__label__positive	Stayed one night on a trip to South Georgia. Great beds, pillows and bedding, nice staff and easy walking distance to good restaurants for dinner. The hotel is on the south side of the highway, away from most of town but not too far to get to Starbucks in the morning. I would definitely stay again.
__label__very_positive	just passing through
__label__positive	My stay was all around good. The bed and pillow comfort surprised me. The bedding was nothing out of the ordinary as far as hotel bedding goes. The room was clean and fit my needs perfectly. The shower had good water pressure which I was very pleased which since almost every hotel I have stayed at recently has had terrible water pressure. My only major gripe about the hotel is the shower surface was not great and the shower pad was old and did not stay stuck to the bottom on the tub. Overall I was very pleased with my stay and I would recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Eugene.
__label__very_negative	Avoid this...
__label__very_negative	Better alternatives nearby
__label__neutral	It was ok. The pictures on the website looked a lot better than in person. Our room had a broken outlet that the wires were exposed and we have a 18 month old daughter and had to make sure she didn't touch it. The bathroom tub was very squeaky. Probably won't be staying there again especially since it was 100 bucks a night. Definitely not worth it. The breakfast was par.
__label__positive	We had a great stay at this hotel, following a minor mix up in our room and having to pay more than we expected.  The hotel (and the town) are kind of a throwback to the great Holiday Inns of my youth.  Nice big pool in The Holidome with a fun game room and lots of room to just relax by the pool and watch the kids play.  The hotel bar was nice and prices were good for a hotel bar.  The complimentary breakfast was better than most, too.Overall, a great place to stay in Fond du Lac!

__label__positive	The color schemes and patterns from the lobby throughout the hotel were unusual, but well done. I truly enjoyed my stay at the hotel over Memorial Day weekend. Old Alexandria was readily available, as was the Metro to go into Washington. It was great to see all the kids and pets in the lobby, too. My only complaint was that the air conditioner in the room was loud when it kicked on, though very effective.
__label__very_positive	8th floor is where the food is at.

__label__positive	Needed a bedroom
__label__negative	My friends and I stayed 3 nights at the Travelodge for our trip to Disneyland. It was about a mile walk but right next to a Denny's which was convenient. The room itself was very outdated and the beds were uncomfortable. We were looking forward to using the pool area, but of course it was closed (for repairs). The people in the room next to us were very loud throughout the night and in the morning which was annoying. The fridge and microwave worked well. The shower was not very clean and the water temperature was either very hot or luke warm depending on the time of the day. The wifi did not work well, so we couldn't even really use it. Luckily, the outdated TV (not a flat screen) did have some great channels. Last but not least, the complimentary breakfast was a couple different cereals, small muffins (not good), and waffles with watered down syrup. We only went to eat there the first morning because it wasn't worth going. Overall, if you're just looking for somewhere to crash after a long day in Anaheim, then this place is great for the price but don't expect much.

__label__very_positive	Perfect stay in Old Alexandria.
__label__negative	Hotel was well below our expectations. We wanted to celebrate our anniversary at a nice hotel in Mallorca but it was subpar at best. Hotel is decorated with antique furniture which made the hotel and the rooms smell pretty bad. They also used this very heavy fragrance which made staying at all common areas, such as lobby or bars, quite unbearable. To make things worse, there was a post in the middle of the room which made moving around difficult in a small room. The hotel told us that we had to pay extra in order to change the room as that was the only room available for the price that we paid. One can probably find a much better hotel for the price you pay for this hotel. Service can certainly improve as well. Location is quite awkward as well. It's about 40 minute walk to the city centre and it's not close to the beaches either. Unfortunately, I don't have anything nice to say about this hotel.
__label__positive	OK for one night . But hotel staff is not friendly in the morning to guests.

The bank of elevators for the casino and parking garage are quite a ways from the room tower elevators. We liked that because it forced us to get in more daily steps. There is a wonderful rooftop pool with a huge TV and fun bar. Family friendly, too!

__label__positive	After saying in a couple of old out-dated hotels, the Red Carpet Inn was a refreshing change! Nicely maintained and clean, the room was large and very adequate for us. Fully loaded with refrigerator, Microwave, flat-screen TV and all the normal amenities offered by the better hotels. Breakfast selections were limited but adequate for our needs however, not much room in the lobby to sit while eating.
__label__positive	Beautiful place
__label__very_positive	Just wonderful- ahead of the rest.
__label__very_positive	The Red Roof Inn is a great, convenient place to stay when in Erie. The front desk staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are comfortable. The air conditioner in our room was having trouble keeping the room cool, and parking can be somewhat of a problem at night especially if you are in the second building. The hotel does not offer a breakfast, however they do offer free vouchers for breakfast at McDonald's which is within walking distance next door to the hotel.
__label__very_positive	Great clean hotel, basic, but comfortable and nice. The breakfast is awesome!
__label__positive	When we got to our room and turn on the AC, mold and dust blew all over the bed. We politely asked for another room, and the management was very nice, gracious, and quick to swap our rooms. After that, we had no problems. Recommend anyone stay here.

__label__negative	This was our first trip to Branson. The hotel is old. Carpet was frayed, chair was saggy, room was damp and musty. Breakfast was gross and not much to pick from. The room was clean, so that was a plus. Would not stay here again, as there seemed to be plenty other places to pick from for the same or better pricing. The location was good, as we were able to walk to some shows and restaurants.

__label__negative	Room stank like old socks, hair in the shower, spider webs in bathroom, dirt dust build up on furniture. Had to call housekeeping to clean room. Bed sheets were smelly, dirty with cigarette holes burned in them. Terrible. This is not a good hotel, I will never stay again.
__label__very_negative	I was so disappointed in this hotel. The pictures on the website were nothing like the rooms. We had 2 rooms which were so far from each other. 1 in 1 building and another room in another building. The staff was super nice. They had no cot to lend us. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone.
__label__very_negative	We decided to stay here after visiting Cedar Point for the day. We figured that it was a big chain and would be nicer than some of the smaller independently owned hotels. We got to our hotel to check in about 1:00am after a long day at Cedar Point and were exhausted. We couldn't wait to check in and go to bed. When I tired to check in I was informed that they had people who decided to stay longer than they reserved the rooms for so they cancelled my reservation, that had been booked for over 2 weeks and already paid for, with no notification. They sent us to find a small hotel, not even close to the same standard, 15 minutes down the road, Needless to say I will not be staying with Holiday Inn in the future. I was thinking about blocking rooms with them for my upcoming wedding but this experience ruled that out. I would be afraid that my out of town guest would try to check in for the weekend only to find they didn't have a place to stay.

__label__very_positive	This was a perfect base camp for touring DC. The metro station was within walking distance and a trolley was also available for getting to and from the metro. On the way to the metro station are lots of unique shops and restaurants. The area was totally safe for walking. The hotel is very close to the waterfront and the Torpedo Factory Art Center and the street entertainment in that area. Located on King Street this is a beautiful area to come back to after the bustle of DC. I hope to return again next year and will definitely stay in this hotel. Wish we had had more time. Highly recommend this beautiful hotel.

__label__positive	I did not book a 5 star hotel, so I went in with realistic expectations. Not everything was perfect in the room but it was clean, comfortable and well cared for. It had a balcony, kitchen and nice bed/bath. Despite having people above and next door to me, there was no noise problems at all. I stayed at this hotel during an intensive class while my peers stayed at other area hotels. They complained of because they had much less space, more noise problems and paid more. For these reasons, this is a hotel that was worth the money and I would stay here again.

__label__very_positive	We rented the grand suit and it was just that! The room was bigger than expected and the dcor was stunning. The grounds were also stunning. As you walk out into the courtyard, you are greeted by a beautiful fountain and garden. Behind that, is the outdoor pool surrounded by lush greenery making it a very peaceful escape. All of this was within walking distance of anything you wanted to see in the French Quarter.
__label__neutral	For the most part, I enjoyed my stay at the Best Western. My room was very clean, had a HUGE television, a Keurig coffeemaker (vast improvement over most hotel coffeemakers), recently redecorated, etc. On the down side...must have been a sealing problem at the base of the toilet, as there was always water on the floor near the toilet wifi was down for two days during my stay and then they changed the password without informing the guests, so for three of the four days I was there, I had no internet access there should be lawn chairs and a couple tables near the spa as there was nowhere to set wrap, glasses, room key, etc. and no way to safely balance to take off shoes, etc. These items are easily fixed and do not stop me from staying there again since location, overall condition, price, etc. are all very reasonable.
__label__neutral	Room had an odd, empty addition to it so I guess that's a suite, no matter since I was alone I just found it interesting. Right next to I-70 but never heard anything from highway. Neighborhood coming into the hotel from exit is a little sketchy but surrounding area was quiet enough.

We stayed the first night of our honeymoon. Person we spoke to on the phone said they didn't do anything special for honeymoon which was fine. When we got to the hotel, however, the manager checked us in. He said that he ALWAYS does something for honeymooners and apologized for the misinformation. Wonderful hotel! No complaints.

__label__very_positive	We were given by mistake a smoking room, we called the front desk and they immediately changed our room. There is an older lady working in the breakfast area she wasn't too happy when she was asked for more coffee, I guess a lot of customers that particular day were coffee drinkers, and she wasn't too happy refilling it. But we really enjoyed our stay and would stay again and recommend it.
__label__very_positive	convenient location
__label__positive	It was a nice room. pleasant to the eye. But the TV keep mess up. But I didn't complain, because we were out most of the day. I didn't know about it because I went to bed.

__label__positive	The Hotel was very nice. The unexpected was the 6.00 per day to park your car at the hotel. I have paid that before in major metropolitan areas but not in Grand Junction. This will be a consideration next time I travel there on business and where I stay. There are many other hotels in a 5 mile drive that do not charge this. Maybe its because it's next to their convention center.
__label__very_positive	Chilling
__label__positive	I come to this hotel every year to visit my sister and i have had a great experience every time until my check out day. The young lady who checked me out was beyond rude. I felt like i was bothering her. I called the mgr Scott and he apologized and upgraded us to a suite during our next visit. The room was great bed was great breakfast was not the best but i got over that. I will visit again and hopefully lil miss stank has an attitude adjustment.

__label__neutral	I stayed on the 2nd floor and as soon as I got off the elevator to go to my room, the whole floor wreaked awful. I thought to myself that the room would smell the same, but it didn't. It was clean and comfy and well laid out. The bedroom had its own door and a very comfortable bed. The only complaints is that there is only a white sheer curtain on the windows that doesn't block the parking lights too much at night. And there is a piece of the metal bedframe that sticks out the side of the bed a few inches. It's not on the corner but along the side in the middle and covered by the blanket. I hit my leg full against it while getting into bed, not expecting it to be there. Needless to say, I had quite a bruise on my leg. The breakfast buffet was average. The price of the room was very expensive for that class of a hotel. I've stayed in Chateaus in Canada that are much nicer and classier for the same price.
__label__positive	Breakfast!
__label__very_negative	Booked our rooms through Hotel.com. The hotel completely cancelled one of our two rooms without notice, forcing my family and me to find lodging elsewhere. So far, I have been unimpressed with the hotel's interest in any sort of remediation.

__label__positive	Upon entering the property you could tell that it was an old building but it seemed to be very clean and comfortable. I hesitate to make a commit about the room because as we found out each room (condo) is individually owed and decorated. I can say that the staff was very professional and promptly took care of any concerns that we had.

__label__positive	Comfortable beds, clean room, pleasant and helpful staff, and very convenient access to stores, restaurants, and main highways at a very reasonable price. Only real complaints would be the musty smell of the hallway and the fire alarm caused by a faulty alarm attachment in one of the rooms...an alarm our daughter didn't even hear in our room on the second floor.
__label__very_positive	Everything was excellent. The only issue I had was the AC. It was fairly loud and since I'm a light sleeper I didn't sleep as well as I'd like. Still would stay again.

__label__very_positive	Stayed here for four nights during our honeymoon trip. The staff was very friendly and the service was great. Hotel is beautiful and our view of the port from our room was awesome. We were on the 6th floor in a partial sea view room. We only heard noise from the street one night and it wasn't bad. Great location for restaurants and night life. Its about a 15 minute walk to the old town/cathedral but the local 3 bus picks up near the front of the hotel and goes to the old town and to some great local beaches (Illetes). We had to figure this out for ourselves. Would have been nice if the hotel had more tourist info.

__label__very_negative	My wife made reservations for September first to the fifth. She called and cancelled the reservations early on the afternoon of the first, due to a family emergency. Later she was charged for one nights lodging even after she had called and cancelled her reservations. I very strongly recommend that no one their right mind would ever stay at this establishment. If their was a way to give a rating of less than zero, i would most definitely do so.

__label__neutral	Okay but nothing special.
__label__neutral	The room was OK getting to it was another matter. We could use the elevator to the 2nd floor only and then had to walk up 2 flights of stairs to the third floor where our room was located. We were not aware of this when we checked in which was a little disconcerting as one in our party had trouble using stairs besides getting the luggage up there also. At the time we arrived it was too late to find a different hotel. We should have been notified of this situation at the time of booking.
__label__very_positive	My wife and I stayed 1 night in mid-August. Very comfortable, small inn, like home ideally located to walk to town. Breakfast was great. Owners (Susie and Ron) were extremely helpful with recommendations and tips. Susie even provided my wife with seeds of one her numerous flowering plants on the porch.
__label__positive	The room was nice compared to the surrounding area. The bed and pillows were comfortable and the TV was nice with a lot of channels. We did not try the WiFi so I cannot comment. My only complaint is that upon cleaning up/leaving the room the housekeeping woman came in. My fiance was still in bed in only his boxers and she let herself in saying I'll start now! it was very rude and unprofessional.
__label__very_positive	Stayed 2 nights for family wedding. Nice place. Will stay again if needed.
__label__very_positive	excellent service
__label__very_positive	Very comfortable
__label__neutral	The condo was decent enough. The ocean view was fabulous. But we were lured into booking for the free parking and wifi. We were never able to log into the wifi. Several light bulbs weren't working. The wall unit A/C did not cool the bedroom down. The biggest surprise was when we were hit with the 130 cleaning fee for our 3 day stay. Re-checking the hotel info, it is listed on the very bottom of the page - we just hadn't scrolled down that far... Won't be making that mistake again!!!

__label__very_positive	First, the exterior physical appearance was of a well-maintained property. It instantly encouraged me. Next, check-in was mercifully efficient. We found the room to be clean but with one issue which was addressed and corrected immediately. The management of this hotel is the most professional and courteous I have ever encountered. My wife and I travel a lot and we have been disappointed more often than not, but this establishment has exceeded the performance of all others.
__label__very_positive	Hunters vile
__label__negative	Don't read this if you don't like whining, because as I wrote this, I realized that's what it sounds like... sorry, but if you want 3 stars or more, you've got some work to do. So, we got a good rate through Expedia, felt good about that. Checking in, well that's where the disappointments started. The lady at the desk was not friendly at all, sloppy, no smile, etc. We got the room keys and the room was clean, so okay, going better. The HVAC controls didn't seem to work as we thought they should - eventually it seemed like it was okay - cooled the room down nicely. The bathroom could have been really nice, but the paint on the wall was cracked and starting to chip. The edge of the tub had one chip repaired and another not yet repaired. On to breakfast in the morning. Eggs were overcooked and cold, but otherwise it was generally okay - nothing to write home about. We used the side entrance several times and the scanner seemed like it was broken like the enclosure was missing, which made it awkward to slide the access card for entry. It is in a good location, close to the freeway and several fast food places.

__label__very_negative	DONT EVER STAY HERE!
__label__positive	Previous stay was during renovation, love the end result and the retro vibe! Room was
__label__very_negative	Terrible
__label__negative	Well, I knew it was a 2-star going in, but a handful of issues made this stay unpleasant. First off, I found four hairs on the bedsheets when I pulled back the covers. Now I know these sometimes get through the wash, but it only takes a minute to take a lint roller or whatever when you make a hotel bed to ensure that the guest gets nice looking unspoiled sheets. Once I noticed that (I was too tired to ask for another room), I started to notice other things: visible stains on laundered hand towels, grubby carpet, very gross looking remote and tv menu card. The last straw was the next morning taking a shower, I pulled back the shower curtain and there was a used washcloth from a previous stay hung up on the shower rod that had been hidden by the curtain until I pulled it back. Gross. I've stayed in a lot of 2 star properties before and 2 star shouldn't mean dirty, it should just mean basic. Wasn't expecting perfection but this really was unpleasant. Oh, and the tissue box ran out of tissues after THREE tissues. Inspecting supplies should be a basic Housekeeping 101, if there are only 3 tissues left in the box you should replace it. Because of the housekeeping I didn't feel like venturing around the Inn to check out any of the other amenities offered like hot tub or breakfast as I felt they'd probably be disappointing as well. Also, there was a sign that said Smoking area is next to hot tub, oooh that sounds pleasant and relaxing...NOT.

__label__neutral	MY PARTNER AND I STAYED AT THE HOTEL BORGO VERDE FOR 6 NIGHTS AND COULD NOT FAULT THIS. WELL A MINOR HICCUP, THE PARKING WAS NOT THAT GOOD, THERE WERE SPACES BUT VERY TIGHT FOR PARKING AND GETTING IN OUT OF THE BUILDING. OTHERWISE NOTHING ELSE WAS WRONG. VALENTINA MOIRA WERE EXCEPTIONAL RECEPTIONISTS WITH HUGE SMILES THAT WOULD HELP YOU IN ANYWAY. THE ROOM WE HAD WAS ROOMY, BATHROOM WAS GOOD SIZE AND WE HAD A BALCONY WITH A BARBECUE IN A QUIET PART OF THE BUILDING. THE BREAKFAST WAS LOVELY AS WAS THE SERVER BUT COULD NOT THINK OF HER NAME. LOCATION WISE WAS FINE, NOTHING REALLY IN WALKING DISTANCE BUT WAS ABOUT 15 MINUTE DRIVE TO DOWNTOWN. THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE WAS MADE SO MUCH NICER WITH VALENTINA MOIRA AND WOULD DEFINITELY STAY THERE AGAIN. THEY ALSO HAD ANOTHER BB WHICH IS SITUATED IN TAORMINA AND WAS THEIR FIRST PROPERTY AND WOULD LOVE TO STAY THERE AS TAORMINA WAS OUR FAVOURITE PART OF SICILY.

__label__positive	The room was decent however, the bathroom needs a shower head and just check on the tv's network signal strength because we were watching tv and the tv cut off and it did not come back on. Other than that it was a decent place to stay.
__label__very_positive	Watching Garden of God and snow-covered Pike Peak from the bed and from the balcony was outstanding. It was very quite and I felt like home while I was staying there. I think it is the best valued hotel in the Colorado Springs.
__label__positive	My experience was good, however, we had booked 4 non-smoking rooms and one of my colleagues was given a smoking room which was very unpleasant. He was not able to get a decent sleep because of the terrible smoke smell in the room. I am sure he would have rated it much lower than I.
__label__very_positive	Excellent staff and great breakfast.Will definitely stay here again.
__label__negative	Hotel is old and run down, but appeared to be clean. Window unit AC provided enough noise to drown out road traffic. Bed was pretty comfortable so I slept well and the WiFi connection was reliable. However, the breakfast was terrible - we ended up getting food at the gas station on the corner. Okay for a night's stay, but don't expect much.

__label__very_positive	My stay was very pleasant for me and my family and I would recommend this hotel two thumbs up any day. However, I would be VERY CAREFUL booking thru hotel.com b/c even though I booked my reservation thru hotel.com, upon arrival the hotel was saying they did not have any rooms available. Hotel.com overbooked them. But after speaking with another employee they were able to accommodate us. Another suite miraculously appeared. So kudos to Hyatt but NOT hotel.com.

__label__neutral	We booked this hotel for a stop during our move cross-country. This hotel is just what you should expect for the price. It's mostly clean but it's not a brand new hotel so you shouldnt expect it to feel pristine. They said they had truck and RV parking but there were two trucks, including our moving truck and that's about all it would fit. Easy one night stop.

__label__very_negative	People at the front desk had no clue about anything and were rude. The tram service was fast and efficient. The pool areas were really nice for the kids. But once again the staff was tough to deal with. Everytime we called with a question about something they were rude on the phone and didn't have any answers and would just bounce us around to someone else who didn't know anything. Finally hold on to your wallet when you are preparing to leave. They hit you with resort fees that aren't disclosed and its per day plus tax on each fee. And also I made a 44 second phone call and next to the phone it says it would be 2.00 a min. Well when the check out bill came they hit me with a 15 connection fee on top of it. totaling about 20 for less than a minute on the phone. called the customer service desk and the lady flat out lied saying it was disclosed on the card next to the phone. What is this the 1920's I think that was another lie about the att connection fee. Then she said well we can't disclose it because att changes the rate all the time. The resort itself was very nice but we will never go back with the way we were treated by staff and the whole organization in general.

__label__very_positive	Great!
__label__very_positive	We always stay in the general area as it is in a convenient for our visits. We've never stayed here at this particular hotel but were very satisfied with the accommodations and the price was with-in our budget. The room was clean, staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was the standard that you may find in many hotels of this level, make your own pancakes, cereal and juice,ect. I had problems connecting my computer to the wi-fi, but the lady at the front desk was very helpful and got me on line. Probably just me and my own ignorance on computers. Overall we were very satisfied and would stay here again.
__label__very_positive	Seriously, the employees at this hotel, the front desk to the housekeepers to the doormen, are some of the friendliest, most competent, helpful and conscientious folks we have found. We travel quite alot, and we find this hotel to be world class! Great location in the heart of Old Town Alexandria, one can be entertained, wined & dined for days within walking distance, no car required. Dog friendly, but you'd never know there are dogs except for seeing them in the lobby... Fun! Room amenities were wonderful... cushy bed/pillows/bedding, big screen TV, stylish furnishings, trendy decor and high end finishes. The lobby is so well appointed with decor and fireplace that people use it regularly to relax! Free coffee/tea/hot chocolate in mornings, free wine in afternoon. Wow, we love this place, and definitely will be back!

__label__positive	Our room was not air conditioned. Normally, it is not needed but we were in a heat wave, so the room was a little warm. Everything else was fine. The motel is 2 blocks from the Embarcadero and close to many shops, restaurants and attraction. We will not hesitate to come here again.

__label__negative	No air conditioning in back bedroom. Window in back bedroom had no screen and the lock was missing/broken off. When I contacted the front desk, they came in and put a broom handle in the runner to act as a lick for the night. Very odd and strange smell in lobby. Room was a bit musty. It is a basic motel and overpriced for what you get.

__label__very_positive	Great Cabin We spent a few days of our spring break with some of our children. The cabin (Secret Garden) was beautiful, comfortable, and clean. We would definitely stay there again! Seriously consider Elk Springs for your next vacation.
__label__very_positive	The Hotel and its grounds are beautiful, to say the least. Very warm, very welcoming, very grand. The staff were incredibly professional and welcoming as well. Everyone from the front desk to the spa to the bar - same level of amazing service. Speaking of the spa - I have never had a spa experience like this. Unbelievable! The ultimate in luxury in relaxation. Due to the flooding in the area we left a night early, just to be on the safe side. They did not charge us the extra night. I am seriously looking for excuses to stay at this hotel again.

__label__positive	Solid..very solid
__label__neutral	We arrived early, so the room wasn't ready. We decided to grab a bite to eat at the restaurant. The restaurant was empty and that should have been a sign. Cobwebs could be seen in the upper windows. A wasp was flying around the entire time. We let the server know the shrimp in the lettuce wraps did not taste good (shrimp itself was going bad) after trying only one bite. After she took it back, she returned to the table to let us know they tried it in the back, thought it tasted just fine, but as a courtesy would take it off our bill. Wow, thanks. Once in our room, there was only conditioner in the bathroom. No shampoo. This is a resort, right We also had a unopened bag of trail mix we left in the room while we went to play golf. We returned to find that ants had eaten a hole through the bottom and were all over the desk. Room is on the 6th floor. We had gnat like bugs hanging out on the ceiling of the bathroom all weekend also. With that said, the hotel has a amazing views of the lake, beds are comfortable and the pool set up is fantastic for both adults and children. A young bellman also went above and beyond to help us set up a shuttle. I would stay here again, but only for the convenience of playing golf in Lakeway.
__label__positive	breakfast was good location was good don't park in the garage they will charge you but it's not posted and pool was closed not good ..
__label__very_positive	Loved the flavor of the hotel. There were many international tourists, families, couples, girls-weekend groups. The staff was friendly and the place was very clean. The continental breakfast was the best spread I'd ever seen. They even had make your own waffle stations. I really liked that even though it was located on a busy street (Rte. 28), when you were in the pool, your room or at the fire pit out back, you did not hear the traffic. By ten o'clock it was pretty quiet with only a couple doors being banged close. My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our get away.
__label__positive	Had a great stay. Room was well outfitted and bed was very comfortable. Took advantage of the hot tub and pool and both were very clean and comfortable. Plenty of towels in the pool area. Lots of restaurants and stores in the area. We will stay here again if we are in the area.

__label__neutral	I only had one issue with my room. The wall that the head of the bed was on only had one outlet and had a lamp and alarm clock plugged into it. To access it, the mattress needed to be pulled away from the wall. While I get over having to plug my phone in on the other side of the room, I still needed to plug my cpap in on that wall. I shouldn't have to unplug the things in the room to be able to breathe at night.

__label__positive	I was in New Orleans for a conference, and stayed an extra two nights to hang with my brother and tour the city. We shared a double Queen room, and were happy it room was more spacious than we expected. Very comfortable and we didn't feel cramped at all. The amenities were comparable to what we'd expect from a nice hotel. And the breakfast was tasty and healthy enough to keep us going all morning long. The location was easy to walk to the French Quarter (we're good walkers), and we found some places to eat nearby when we were too tired to go farther away. My only complaint is that the guys handling our luggage storage were abysmally slow. We had to wait up to 15 minutes to have someone get our luggage out of storage. Other than that, the staff were great and very friendly.

__label__very_negative	The only thing good about this hotel was the treatment from the staff. I was very unhappy with the condition of the hotel and the rooms. I did better off sleeping in my car. The only reason why I stayed was because of a funeral for my brother that passed. I will not be visiting this location ever again. This must really be a joke on websites stating the good reviews at this hotel. Just terrible and it will not be recommended to anyone I know that is for sure.

__label__very_positive	Had fun playing Let It Ride. I had a great dealer at the Plaza and walked away with money. And I love the bar back by the Valet Parking. Good service and good poker machines.
__label__positive	Was impressed by the decor, the rooms, the reasonable rates. Was not impressed when my air conditioner iced over and stopped working, and the only way to fix was to turn on the heat to melt the ice. When the ice didn't melt all the way, I was advised simply to turn the air conditioner off. Not really the best solution in D.C.-area heat. The result was a very uncomfortable night. I would make sure the AC unit in your room is working before you stay here -- but otherwise, my stay was lovely.

Rooms have been renovated to include glass shower doors, upgraded bedding and patio and lounge furniture. always enjoy the restaurants, upgraded night shows and grounds. Would definitely recommend.

__label__very_positive	We have been customers with Drury Inn for almost 10 years... Our stays have always been comfortable and we will continue to come back. I have to commend the job from your Asst. Manager Richard S., he was helpful and attentive to both us and whoever I saw him dealing with. On top of that, all the staff we encountered.., greeted us or were over polite in allowing to pass or gain access to wherever we were headed. Definitely a 5 star staff.... Next visit to Columbus, we will surely stay there again. The only issue we had was dealing with elevator wait time..., but since our legs work just fine.. I don't mind stairs. God Bless

The window also had been opened at one time or another over the years and the window insulation was pulled inside the area between the screen and glass.

__label__very_negative	When we first checked in the receptionist was very rude, not only to us but others that were walking in. Then we get to the room and it seemed everything was okay, but on the 2nd day we were there, one of the legs broke on the bed around 4pm while I was taking a nap. I went to the front desk to inform them about this and asked if they could have maintenance come over to fix it while we would be out till 10 or 11pm. When we returned the bed was still broke. I went to the front desk and asked if they would comp the price of the room for the night. He proceeded to get upset with me and told me to check out and then he would refund the price. This was all on a very busy weekend in San Antonio, due to high school graduations and there were no rooms available around the area. Therefore we had to end up sleeping on the pull out sofa. Very uncomfortable for someone who has had 6 back surgeries. Stay away from this place, would not recommend it to my worst enemy. Plus my parents had a room there also and had roaches in their room, DISGUSTING!!!

__label__positive	This hotel was booked only for its location. You can't beat a hotel directly across the street from a theme park. The room was a good size and was clean. It looked like they just got new furniture and fixtures. The bathroom was a little outdated and dingy but was clean. I have nothing spectacular to say about the hotel, but also nothing awful to say. I'd probably stay here again.
__label__very_positive	Great Stay!!
__label__very_positive	As a couple who visited casinos all over, we know GREAT employess when we meet them. I.P. Casino is our favorite and michelle is the best, most efficient beverage server ever. Keeping her 'mt's picked up. She has an enormous ability to make old people feel young. Her smile and upbeat attitude is the bright spot in our saturdays.
__label__negative	The back door to the parking lot was left unlocked at night so that anyone could walk in. Since my room was next to the door and the hotel is not in the best location, I didn't feel safe. Also, it doesn't have an elevator, so second floor access with bags was difficult.

The refrigerator was also on a shelf that was too high for me to access very easily.

__label__very_positive	We stayed for three nights with our grandson and had no complaints at all about the hotel or service. The property was well maintained and the staff were friendly and well informed. Would definitely stay again.
__label__neutral	Hotel was good for an over night stay. No air conditioner in the sitting room, so it got kinda hot in there because the air did not circulate well. Breakfast bar was good and had lots of choices. Staff was nice and very helpful. Only about 15 channels on the tv, and nothing for kids to watch.
__label__very_positive	We arrived early hotel was very accommodating allowing us to check in early. Very clean, quiet, quaint. It was older but clean.
__label__very_positive	Star treatment for everyone!
__label__very_positive	Nice hotel for the money. Room was clean but was missing toiletries. They were quick to bring them to us.
__label__very_positive	dinner menu is pricey, and the entrees are very uninspired. your much better of a little way up the road at carrabba's.
__label__very_negative	The elevator always smelled like roach spray. The shower made noise when the pipe was turned on and throughout the shower. The refrigerator and microwave were substandard and not housed in a cabinet.
__label__very_negative	Room was filthy. Toenails on the floor. No door knob on bathroom. Electrical outlet hanging out of the wall. Suppose to be a suite, seemed like a normal room to me.
__label__positive	Convenient, but not comfy The beds at this hotel are like bricks. Absolutely horrible. So hard that you'll wake with aches and pains. And the pillows! Knotty, squashed. I've stayed here two weekends. The first time I hardly slept. The second time I brought my own pillows and quilts and slept much better. It is convenient, though.
__label__positive	The price was right for the visit. It got me close to where I needed to be. Walmart was right down the street for the necessities I had forgotten and Sams was up the street to fill up for gas.
__label__positive	Easy on and off the highway.
__label__very_negative	Dungeons, Drain Flies and Centipedes
__label__very_negative	Always check your room....
__label__positive	This small restaurant is casual by day, see and be seen by night. The lunch menu is reasonably priced, and the selling point is the wood oven-baked pizzas. Would definitely recommend, especially for day-trippers shopping in Atlantic Station. It's a good alternative to some of the other restaurants in the area.
__label__very_negative	I booked a and room for my son's girlfriend who came in from out of town and it was dirty not ready so they moved me to another room, it was about the same. I would never stay here again.

__label__very_positive	Great time, enjoyed the wine hour in the early evening. The only thing I didn't like was the coffee that was out out in the mornings, truly watered down- and I wouldn't be fm difficult if they didn't advertise it as artisan coffee. Spend less money on the cool design on the cups, and more on the quality of the coffee.

__label__positive	Hotel staff were exceptionally professional, helpful and courteous.  Enjoyed the morning coffee, afternoon lemonade and the physical fitness facilities. Hotel is located in a very rich and diverse area of town, close to the river; as well as to the DC Metro line.  The only downside was a very noisy Saturday night/Sunday morning in our hallway with inconsiderate guests talking very loudly.
__label__very_positive	This was a quick trip to Dublin VA for a funeral. They were very accommodating and got me in my room earlier so I could dress for funeral. I did not get back until late and then left early the next morning. I would stay there again if I happen to be in the area.

__label__very_positive	I recently stayed here and was very impressed with this property. My room had been remodeled to a level I have never seen at an econo lodge. The furniture was stylish and functional. The coup de grace was the bathroom. It was a little smaller than most but the use of granite stone slabs on the vanity and more importantly on the bath walls gave a very luxurious feel.

__label__very_positive	I TOTALLY disagree with the previous post. Tonys is incredibly professional ! He did the food service at my company for many years. We were all very sad when he left. So unlike the first person, I have had many encounters with Tony and his staff all were super. Many of his staff, said great things about working for Tony - even when he was not around. He also did our holiday parties. The food was fabulous. He catered our in-house meetings never having a problem with we changed things at the last minute. I have been at multiple events at both Fairview Club and Hotel Deca that Tony catered and all were excellent. Tonys Events and Catering is HIGHLY RECOMMENDABLE

__label__negative	Easy check in and check out process. Housekeeping was very friendly and thorough. Room was VERY noisy. I could hear all noise from the next room, the room above me, outside and through the hallway. Also, the room fan wouldn't work and the temperature in the room was difficult to regulate.

No A/C (not needed as its coastal area)...but, we love sleeping with window wide open, I love that. Very quiet. Never heard single noise or even any cars all night.

__label__negative	Unfortunately we decided to book a night at this hotel because of how close it was to the Pomona Fairplex. The Super 8 was an older hotel. The front desk lady was friendly and courteous. We checked into the room, but left to get something to eat since there are plenty of different restaurants in the area. We came back to the room for the night and noticed that the bedding was very old and the mattress and box spring were old and broken. The box spring had parts of the coil sticking out and my wife scratched her leg. The fan in the bathroom was broken and hanging from the ceiling. We advised the staff of the issues the following morning to avoid the hassle of going to another room. I would not recommend this hotel and think that the 2 star rating is too high. This hotel is in need of maintenance and who ever manages it doesn't seem to care enough to fix the obvious problems.

__label__positive	I enjoyed my stay at the Holiday in Express. My room was clean and it was conveniently located. The bed was a little firm for my liking. My only issue was that the toilet was running a lot. But for the price, it was overall very comfortable and it was clean which is most important to me.

__label__positive	I enjoyed my stay and will use them again
__label__positive	overall, it was worth it; however, they really do allow dogs and there were lots of them. they only have one floor that is dog free and all rooms were taken on that floor. we had two dogs barking on our floor and after complaining over a 2-3 hour period, one of the families checked out. the hotel did offer to move us and gave us coupons for continental breakfast but again, we were going to a floor that might have dogs. we stayed in our original room and it all worked out by about 9 pm, but then I was freaked out that dogs had stayed in our room before, peeing, jumping on beds etc. I have dogs, I know dogs, it's just odd that such a nice hotel is also 'the dog' hotel.

__label__very_positive	Nice hotel and staff
__label__positive	Attentive staff. Good food plenty to drink. There are some negatives. The staff was constantly pressuring us to go to the presentation to buy into the the development. I found myself trying to hid from them. The beach is unusable due to the staff keeping us from the beach surf because some people drowned. They didn't tell me in advance of these things. I believe I'll stay somewhere else next time.
__label__very_positive	Large room and pool!
__label__very_positive	I needed a place to stay while im in the process of moving and i would reccommend this facility staff was very friendly and helpful price was reasonable i will be staying here again a big high five from me thanks
__label__positive	A nice pleasant stay

But my wife has far higher criteria, and she's attracted to AmericInn Lodges far more devotedly than she is to me. As always, our stay in this one--Princeton, IL--was just fine.

__label__positive	We often stay at Hampton Inns when we travel, that's the main reason we selected this hotel. It was quiet, clean, uncrowded and comfortable. The staff was pleasant and helpful. We would stay here again if we are in the area.

__label__positive	Roach hotel
__label__neutral	The hotel is average.room was clean. The bed and pillows were very comfy and the free breakfast was somewhat larger than other hotels I've stay at. There is one elevator that is adjacent to the lobby so if you had the misfortune of getting a room on the third floor on the opposite end of the hotel, as I did,... More
__label__positive	Doesn't get better than this for a cheap motel
__label__positive	Will definitely stay here again. Great location, nice rooms, friendly staff. Walls are a bit thin so we could hear the people in the next room so maybe bring ear plugs.
__label__very_positive	Catania ist wild aber das Hotel eine Oase der Ruhe
__label__very_positive	The bed and pillows were terrible. The property was old and didn't feel clean at all. We tried the Hot Tube one evening and it was so hot we couldn't even get in and hardly had any jet action anyway. No one at the front desk seemed concerned about this. It was right on the beach and we had free parking.

__label__neutral	Overall the stay was good but was a little disappointed with the breakfast just wasn't enough space opened up for sitting and the layout of the food area could use some work it was really congested trying to fix your food while others were waiting on the waffles and the toasters to finish heating

__label__positive	Staff was wonderful and the pool and fitness facilities were nice. Close to good food and an outdoor mall/shopping center. The breakfast was great, but very crowded at 8:30 a.m. when we went to eat! Needs a much larger breakfast room.
__label__negative	Gostei muito do hotel. Porem s quando entrei no hotel que verifiquei que havia comprado um pacote para nossa famlia( 7 pessoas, ou seja 3 quartos) sem caf da manh, tentei negociar um desconto com a gerente Elen, porem ela no me deu alternativas, alegando que o restaurante terceirizado. O tendimento deixou a desejar, demorado. A sauna mida estava com problemas na caldeira, ou seja no utilizamos. Tive que mudar de quarto, pois o ar condicionado estava com problema de refrigerao, tive que ligar vrias vezes para poderem verificar isso. Gostei da piscina, muito boa...
__label__very_positive	I was very impressed with the service and true kindness of the staff on duty, outstanding on the job well done.
__label__very_positive	Outstanding Location and Great Service
__label__negative	A place to sleep
__label__neutral	Our room wasn't very clean with blood or puke dripping down the toilet. We had to get our keys reprogrammed each day. The room doors slam shut and there isn't much noise proofing so that woke us up. The free wi-fi is only free after you sign up for a loyalty program. It is nicely decorated though.
__label__neutral	Average.
__label__positive	This was the first time I tried Candlewood in the IHG-chain. All in all a positive experience but I notice some differences from what I have been used too no free breakfast is included but they have a shop where you can buy some food.

__label__negative	Our first clue of how this stay was going to go should have been when the lady checking us in didn't know exactly where our room was located. We had the loudest neighbor ever. Constant coughing from them all night. Had to leave the tv on just to drown out the noise. At about 9:00 the next morning housekeeping started... More

__label__very_positive	Stay as high as you can as this hotel has 6 floors. Pool is very nice and quiet with a gated walk out area. Since its on the river, it's a nice extension to your swimming adventure if you do that. Restaurant is very nice, we have eaten there more than 1 time, very eclectic menu. We had great service...

__label__positive	Comfortable
__label__negative	Airport shuttle doesn't run until 7:30 am. When asked for help to accommodate 7:30 am flight time, not only was it no, but no with an attitude. (3 different people) Other small things as well. No attention to small things the biz traveler would like.
__label__very_positive	Had a short layover in Istanbul. Wanted a hotel near the airport. Met all our expectations except picking us up at the airport. Was told they had shuttle, but was going to be 1 1/2 hours to wait. Not acceptable. Took a taxi.
__label__very_positive	We came in on the last night of a music festival so they gave us a room facing the courtyard which was much appreciated. Also referred us to great restaurants.

__label__very_negative	Possibly the smokiest hotel room I've ever been in. Pulling the covers up would release yet another cloud of smoke an awful experience, for sure. To top it off, upon return home, everything in our bags, including the bags themselves required washing! Old and smoky.
__label__positive	This new hotel is much needed, as area hotels book up quickly on game days in Eugene. The price is definitely right. Intended more as a long-term stay hotel, each room is set up nicely with a kitchenette, and a long desk/dining table along the wall, with an office chair, a dining chair, and an easy chair. Bed was comfy,... More
__label__very_positive	We had a nice stay. Only thing wrong was us getting there late and not being able to enjoy all that the hotel had to offer. We will return to this hotel if we run the same race next year. This Hampton was the best value I've seen in years and without losing any amminities. Great hotel!
__label__negative	Very loud hotel with very thin floors and walls

__label__very_negative	There was no stay. They did not honor the reservation, what few rooms were left were unacceptable. The hotel clerk was disinterested and unhelpful. She made no attempt to help or remedy the situation. The street was also unremarkable to the point that I missed it and had to U-turn down the road. We stayed at another hotel on a walk-in basis. I don't believe we should have to pay a cancellation fee for such terrible service.

__label__positive	Convenient for a Meeting I attended.
__label__very_positive	The hotel was very well located for our purposes with a number of restaurants within walking distance. We felt very comfortable walking to them. Having both a bedroom and sitting room was very convenient when one of us wanted to sleep late. Nice breakfast included in the room price. Would not hesitate to stay here again.

__label__very_positive	This was my first visit to this hotel on a recommendation - loved it. Beautiful room: comfy bed, great amenities, very helpful and nice staff. Not too far from the metro (a little bit of a walk, but not too bad). Wonderful little shops surrounding it. Only thing missing was a continental breakfast in the morning, but there are plenty of little cafes surrounding to make up for that!
__label__negative	Won't stay here again.
__label__neutral	Lobby was under construction but no noise at night. Room smelled musty and smokey. Breakfast was bread, cereal, yogurt and hard boiled egg. Not worth eating there for breakfast. Staff was not friendly.

__label__positive	Great pool!!
__label__very_positive	not pet friendly?
__label__very_positive	Awesome place
__label__very_positive	We had the perfect hotel for our stay in N.O. Bourbon street close by, Superdome, Harrah's Casino all close by. A little further is the French Quarters. We walked everywhere. No need for a vehicle. The staff was friendly and breakfast was good. Would stay there again. Only one thing. We were there six nights. They didn't vacuum until the fourth night. Other than that, it was perfect.
__label__positive	Spending about 2/3 of my life in hotels, I'm sick of the regular 'continental breakfast'. This is one of the better ones I have seen. Fresh fruits, nuts, boiled eggs. I don't eat waffles but an amazing choice of toppings if you do. Love having a laundry in a hotel. It really helps me choose where I will stay and it was only 75 cents a wash.
__label__very_negative	We were in town for one night for a wedding and made the last minute decision to stay overnight instead of driving back home. This was a just down the street from the wedding site, so we decided to try it. Unfortunately the room smelled horrible of stale cigarette smoke, there were stains on the wall and a big hole in the bathroom wall, hair on the pillows and the TV did not work at all! Plus when we arrived their internet was down so there was no way for them to see our paid reservation and I ended up having to contact hotels.com to then contact the motel to confirm everything. The nighttime attendant Marcus was as helpful as he could be, but overall a terrible experience.
__label__very_positive	Lovely Bed Breakfast
__label__very_positive	Booked the hotel early July 7-16 I do my research months before we leave on a trip, according to it advertisement it was what I was looking for, great price, bottom floor, breakfast, free parking, easy on and off highway, the place was clean, staff very friendly from the time we checked in, our friends booked at the same time,...

__label__neutral	About what you'd expect for a less expensive night's stay. Clean, somewhat updated recently, but nothing fancy. Located off of I25 on the northern outskirts of Cheyenne, across the street from railroad tracks and warehouses. Several noisy trains went by during the evening, although they didn't wake me during the night. Several other, newer hotels in the immediate area, but not many places to eat or get gas.

Of course the hotel rooms have to clean and comfortable, however, it is people like Frank and Daniel that make the stay a pleasure.
__label__positive	Great 3 day wkend at Tidewater
__label__positive	Very convenient to the airport. No airport nosie. The room was great: bed was super cozy, had a nice flat screen TV with good channels, and we were happy that it had a microwave and fridge. It was a great place to stay, and we will definitely stay here again when we're in the area.
__label__very_negative	Would have given good reviews had
__label__positive	Very nice
__label__neutral	shower curtain drips water on the nearby floor. have to mop up the water every time we use shower. very inconvenient. elevator is so slow and jerky. room cleaner brings giant cart on elevator leaving little space for guests on same elevator.
__label__negative	There was an unpleasant odor in the h hallways that smelled like cigarette smoke and disinfectant. The equipment in the fitness center was in very poor condition. One treadmill did not work at all. The other was permanently stuck on an incline and digital display did not work. Overall the hotel had a shabby appearance.
__label__very_positive	Wonderful stay. Wonderful pools and whirlpool overlooking the lake, beautiful views, nice affordable breakfast buffet, very quiet, beautiful room, helpful staff. No complaints, great resort.
__label__neutral	The hotel was under renovation so there were challenges due to that. Our room AC was not working so we had to move rooms and the room we were moved to had an extremely tiny bathroom compared to the first room.
__label__very_negative	Embarrassing
__label__neutral	The hotel offers a lovely surround with very helpful staff. Breakfast is a great variety of foods and is sure to please most. The rooms are small but quaint and the showers are amazing. It's true they have the world's smallest lift so patience is necessary. Don't stay here if you want another sterile, boring, Ikea style hotel........it's for those who appreciate it's charm.
__label__very_negative	"Not so great. My band mates and I drove 20 hours straight, walk into the hotel, and when I started the check in process he clerk said ""I don't want any problems"". He also mentioned not wanting to have to call the police and basically implied that he didn't want us there. We were polite, and respectful the whole time. When it was time for the continental breakfast, there were no tables available, so we sat on the the couch that was 4 feet from the juice machine, and we were told to go find a table. The safe in the room was locked with the door open so we couldn't store our cash in there. We left for NYC, came back, and my buddy's bag was rummaged through. He always leaves his orange hunting knife on top of his clothes, but it was under his sweatshirt and a few other things when we got back. The screen onthe door to get on the ""patio"" was ripped from the bottom and up the side. The curtain was detached from the stick that you use to open and close them. I was not impressed with the stay. Not worth $120 a night."
__label__neutral	The lobby and breakfast area were very nice and clean. The girl at the desk was very friendly. However my non smoking room reaked of smoke and we found a container of chewing tobacco in the bedside table. My three-year-old also pulled out two 2 x 4 is from underneath the bed. The bathroom was clean.
__label__very_positive	Nice hotel, great location
__label__positive	Everything was great - very clean hotel, very clean room, excellent service at the front desk, great variety of food at breakfast. Only downside was the cost.
__label__positive	for the price, i was pleasantly surprised, it was clean and comfortable.. i would stay again....
__label__positive	Great hotel in prime location. Plenty to do in Old Town Alexandria. Close to transport for easy access to Arlington or Washington. Rooms very clean and comfortable. Air conditioner a bit noisy but this seems to be common in the older buildings that have been renovated.
__label__neutral	A well-known, mid-priced national and international hotel chain where kids always stay free. In ShortHoward Johnson's story began in 1925, with an ice cream stand that soon became a chain of orange-roofed restaurants, and eventually motor lodges. Today, the hotels offer quality accommodations at value prices for families and business travelers. Comforts of Home amenities include in-room coffeemakers, complimentary weekday newspapers and more. Most locations offer Home Office rooms, with work desks and chairs, and Crayola Kids Rooms, with Crayola easels and accessories, plus a mini-fridge and microwave.
__label__positive	Good for Business Stay
__label__very_positive	Our room included a patio with a view of the mountains. The king size bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. The laminated floors were shiny and well kept. I usually have problems with hotel rooms because of the carpeting. The only carpeting was around the bed so you didnt have to put your feet on cold floors when you first get up. There were two vanities across from one another so there was plenty of room to get ready without being in anyones way. It also included a walk in closet.
__label__neutral	Fair hotel...never got a chance to try the breakfast...hot tub was nice after hanging tree stands all day...good stay for the price.
__label__positive	This property is an excellent hotel for my family. The location is easy to find right off the freeway exit and very close to the cruise terminal. Staff are friendly and room is clean. Plenty of breakfast food. We will definitely come back.

__label__very_positive	Good bed, VERY NICE restaurant (expensive), quiet, clean, pleasant room. Will definitely return.
__label__very_positive	comfortable stay
__label__neutral	Location was the only issue here. The area is mostly offices, so it's pretty sparse at night. Restaurants were all a few blocks away, so a perfectly fine walking distance, but because that immediate area was so desolate at night and not well lit, I didn't feel comfortable walking far.

__label__very_negative	Rooms very run down. Had to get a change of room. Still rundown. Ran out of food at breakfast
__label__positive	Overall we were very satisfied with our stay. We were glad to see that many renovations are in the process of being completed, and hopefully will continue. The rooms are dated, but clean. We had dinner in the bar area and breakfast in the dining room. Both were excellent with generous portions! If the need arises, we would definitely stay at this property again.
__label__very_positive	The hotel is not deluxe but very satisfactory for stays whether business or tourism.
__label__neutral	Good price poor rooms
__label__neutral	This motel is located 2 - 3 miles off of Interstate 35. There are eating places available, but nothing fancy. The motel has been remodeled recently and is quite comfortable and attractive on the inside. On the outside it is pretty plain and has very limited parking that is convenient. The breakfast is limited.
__label__very_negative	Horrible. I have to cancel my remaining night to a better hotel
__label__positive	We enjoyed our stay at the San Marcos Inn. The room was comfortable, quiet, and a quick walk in two different directions to the quaint shops that make up Morro Bay. We found this on Hotelcoupons.com, which gave us a great room rate, and we were quite pleased with our experience.

__label__very_positive	Pleasant stay
__label__positive	Perfectly Pleasant
__label__positive	Good location/but noise a BIG Problem
__label__positive	This is a newer hotel that was having some maintenance issues while we where there. Pool was about 95F when we went in and the main Air conditioning went down during the night. Room was great and we had a restful night. Hotel is close to a Walmart which is very convenient.
__label__positive	I was here for a convention and never had to leave the building (If I didn't want to)...convention hall is connected, breakfast and dinner are served (with 3 free drinks) and they have fresh popcorn and soft drinks available during the day. What more could you ask for. Room was clean. No mini-shampoos here...shampoo, conditioner and body wash...all given out... More
__label__very_positive	THE ROOM AND STAFF WERE EXCELLENT.
__label__very_positive	Great
__label__positive	nice hotel close to interstate and the farm show.
__label__very_positive	Front desk staff was ridiculous at every moment.  Housekeeping started knocking too early. Room was tiny except closet was walk-in.
__label__positive	My mom was at Stanford Hospital and since her discharge date got pushed to a couple days later, we needed a room to stay the night because we were visiting from Fresno. There are plenty of rooms near the hospital but they're crazy expensive and surprisingly always fully booked. So this Best Western in Sunnyvale was about 20 minutes away, easy to find and conveniently near the freeway to head back to the hospital. Also the rate wasn't bad at all. Not compared to the room I stayed at in Palo Alto the weekend before. The staff was cool and my dad enjoyed the breakfast very much. I'd stay there again.

The new owners are not only friendly but they are so honest about providing the best in service. The rooms are decorated with great space and comfort, and with a deliscious breakfast every morning and a cheese and wine social in the evenings. Allows you to indugle and meet those just as lucky. Rumor has it this spring brings more improvement in the of rooms, flat screen tv's and more service's.......thank you to the staff for their dedication and thank you to the management for urge to revisit and experience this inn over and over.

__label__very_positive	Some of the best food in Utah independent of price. I was looking for someplace new, saw this, and decided to take a risk. What a pleasant surprise. The Blue Boar is my new favorite restaurant - so good I almost want to keep it a secret. The food was impeccable. It deserves the best European food in Utah award. The service was great. The atmosphere was a cozy romantic one. You would pay much more for food this good anywhere else in SLC or Park City. They told us to check out the incredible special on Wednesday nights. Ill be doing that.

__label__neutral	This place sufficed for an overnight stay. The room itself was clean overall, however,
__label__negative	Bed was hard as a rock, pillows were very small and uncomfortable. The toilet was right up against one wall so going to the bathroom was awkward. When I asked for a receipt after I checked out I was told I couldn't have one and that Expedia would be getting me a receipt. So, I have no idea if I was charged the correct price or if there were any unauthorized add-ons attached. Because this was for a business trip, I have no receipt for reimbursement. I've never had that experience with any other hotel I've stayed at. Will not be returning to this Super 8,.

__label__negative	Booked non smoking rooms...the rooms(2) we were given had definitely been smoked in recently and indeed had ash trays on the desk and night stand- they even made us sign that we would not smoke in the rooms or face an extra charge...last day Sunday rooms were not made up nor towels refreshed even though we had departed for the day at 09:30. The Breakfast was a Puritan Continental Breakfast...nothing special. Hall was musty and dank.
__label__neutral	Hotel is conveniently located close to Stewart International Airport. The hotel sits off the street so road noise was not an issue. The staff I interacted with, especially Kirsten) was very friendly. The included continental breakfast was what you would expect. The remote for the TV did not work and I was provided with another one and instructions on how to program it. It didn't work either. The bathroom did not get the attention that most people would expect. It was dusty, and had hairs on the floor upon my arrival. When I returned at the end of the day after room service, they were still there. That could have been better. The price was decent, but I would shop the competitors before choosing to stay here again.

__label__very_negative	Horrible and stinky room
__label__positive	Overall not a bad motel. It was packed when I got there. The room I booked was nice and clean. The bed was comfy. The only issue was the battery in the smoke detector was dead when I got there. The beeping was slowly driving me crazy. I notified the front desk and was told someone could fix it around 11:00. I was fine with that it was after 10 when I got there. Went in search of food, came back, ate and still no one showed up. I finally got fed up and took it down. Someone had already ripped it from the wall before I arrived. It was about 11:50 when it was finally fixed. Was woken up about 7:30 by kids running upstairs in the hall. So I went ahead and packed up and checked out by 9. I think if it wasn't so packed it would have been better, plus it was a Saturday night. I give it 4/5. Would stay again.

__label__neutral	It was a rough start to our trip, with a long day in the sun followed by a car crash in a parking lot. It was pouring rain when we got to the hotel and the lot was flooded, ankle deep in some places. When we finally got back to our room at nearly 10:00p.m. all we wanted to do was shower and sleep. However, there was no running water in our shower/tub. There was no phone in the room to call the office with, no one in the office after I found the number and called with my cell phone. I never the rain again to walk to the bar, hoping the bar tender could give me a number to call. Thankfully, that's where I found Bill, night security and maintenance. He did his best, but was unable to fix our shower quickly, so he upgraded our room and got us moved right away. Bill saved our trip, and turned a very frustrating day into a great night's sleep

__label__negative	Hotel is under construction, so it will be nice upon completion, but we were not warned of the construction when we booked, and found it to be inconvenient. The pool area will be amazing, but because of the construction, we couldn't swim as the pool room was so cold. In addition, the first room we were shown was dirty and had been smoked in. They did re-room us, and staff was nice, but we went from a room with two queen beds to one bed, and a small bathroom.

__label__positive	The room was comfortable but the furniture was dated. Great place to relax and walk around. Short drive to shopping and sightseeing.
__label__very_positive	My stay was great. I booked ahead and used their no-cancellation reservation, which resulted in a much cheaper stay. I also liked that they did not increase rates due to the Packer game, as I found many other hotels did. It was a short drive (less than an hour) to Green Bay for my next-day appointment. I really liked the Bath and Body Works toiletry supplies and enjoyed their free made-to-order breakfast in the restaurant located on-site. I would recommend to anyone staying in the area (including Green Bay, Oshkosh and/or Appleton) and I will be staying there again when the time arises.
__label__very_positive	Had a welcoming check in process and quick. We got a ocean view and it was amazing that there was nothing in front of our window blocking the view. Our door was the close test to the pool and the beach just a short walk away. All the rooms have just been remolded and very clean and tidy. The restaurant and bar area was very nice as well. Self parking is convenient and close.

__label__positive	The hotel is in a prime location. Close to the highway and easy to get to. Breakfast was OK, but lacked variety. Some eggs and more fruit options would have been nice. The other issue is how loud it was in the halls at night. Doors banging and people talking went right through the walls. Hard to get a good night sleep. The front desk was very helpful and friendly. I did have trouble accessing the WiFi. Overall it wasn't a bad stay but there were issues.

(I did end up getting 2 queens). Room is small and standard - 2 beds, desk, chair, big TV, mini fridge. The hotel room was damp and musty. Even with all the lights on and window shades open, the room is dark. There was definitely a smell in the room.

__label__positive	Overall this hotel was great, but I had one problem with the front desk, and that problem I request crib for my 2 kids and they only gave me 1, I had to wait units the following day for the second crib.
__label__neutral	The hotel overall was great, but just after 10PM I could smell a strong odor of weed (I cant use the actual name of the drug that was buring, since it appears that the comment program does not allow the word to be used, I guess the truth is not acceptable) coming from the hallway.  I went out of my room and the hall was smokey.  I reported this to the front desk, and they investigated it, but told me there was nothing they could do since they couldn't tell which room it was coming from.  I had to stuff a towel under my door to try and keep the smell out, and it would have been nice if they would have atleast did something to vent the air in the hallway.  Other then this incident, it is a beautiful hotel in a prime location.  I just expected to actually enjoy my room for the money that I spent.

It smelled like an ash tray, bedding had burn holes in it. Staff was very nice and helpful but was a very nasty feeling in either room. The second room didn't smell like an ash tray but did have a weird funk to it. There were random hairs find in the room. The ac was having a hard time keeping up on a 75day.

__label__neutral	Property Review
__label__very_negative	I booked a room through Expedia for 2 nights at this hotel. I decided I wanted a third night, so I called the hotel directly to ask if our room would be available on Friday. I was told it was available and that I did not need to give a credit card number to hold the reservation. When I checked in at the hotel on Wednesday, my two-day Expedia reservation was fine, but there was no record of my conversation with the hotel clerk from the previous week. I was very upset that I had just driven hours to find out my vacation was compromised. I was also pretty angry, and expressed this to the hotel owner, demanding that he honor my need for a room on Friday because his employee failed to reserve the room for me. He felt that I was making a scene, and threatened to cancel my Expedia reservation, saying I could find somewhere else to stay. I didn't want to lose my entire vacation, so when he vaguely promised to find me another room for Friday, I thanked him. There aren't enough characters allowed to go describe everything that happened in my three days there. The worst of it was, when we finally settled the Friday night room situation, we ended up getting locked out of our room by the hotel, claiming it wasn't paid for. The owner put the reservation for the night under his own name, and he himself processed my credit card on Wednesday when I checked in, yet his staff claimed it wasn't there. The Tidewater Inn nearly ruined my only vacation this year. Do not stay there!!!!

__label__very_positive	Great ! We've stayed in MANY BBs across the country and for 160- 180 a night this was by far the best! There was nothing I'd like to change and nothing either of us could find fault with. It was specail and you really feel like part of the family - like your grandparents are taking care of you while you're visiting their house. OH and the midnight snacks/deserts they leave out are amazing! You even get discounts at local restaurants and a free glass of wine! THIS PLACE IS THE BEST!
__label__neutral	Stay was good...last minute. Was pricey for one night, yet a three day weekend, would never pay that again. No breakfast, couldn't get coffee till 8:30am. The TV wouldn't come in with color...tried everything could think of. Overall great location, nothing fancy. Served the purpose. Front desk folks very nice and place was clean.

__label__neutral	Given the proximity to a Wal-Mart this hotel is pretty great to set off on any trip around the Indianapolis area. Overall a great value but the hotel staff did not meet my expectations. Even though the front desk says '24 Hour Service,' we had to wake up the guy working asleep in the back office in order to check out!

__label__very_negative	Has pretty much everything you need and great staff. The gym has a good number of cardio machines, free weights, and there's a decent sized pool. WiFi was pretty good.

__label__positive	A couple blocks from Bourbon St. Quiet area but the street hotel is on (Rampart) is broken down and looks sketchy. It was safe, but doesn't give a good impression. Free warm breakfast in the mornings was good. They have a bar and small lounge area but no kitchen. Multiple places deliver to the hotel if you dont feel like going out though. They had a parking garage. If I would have known that I probably would have rented a car for my stay. Overall a decent hotel, but nothing too fancy.

__label__very_negative	Disappointed and too tired to complain
__label__neutral	Not an easy task to find a decent and affordable BB in Cambridge for a 1-week stay. This one is charmful but room is not so convenient: furniture is outdated and A/C quite noisy. Not adapted to business trip (didn't know where to put my luggage) but most likely perfect for backpackers. The innkeeper is very nice and talkative which is great. I did enjoy our morning chatting when he was preparing breakfast (invariably a stuffed crepe with home made fruit compote and valilla yogurt) and good filtered coffee.
__label__neutral	The hotel was nice in the front however our room was showing it's wear.  The carpet was stained and in pretty bad shape however everything else was fine.  Beds were comfortable and bathroom was clean.  TV channels were not that great however that was not a major issue.  As the hotel is under renovation, I am hoping that carpets and windows are part of the reno.  Would probably stay there again.

Budget-conscious travelers will appreciate free continental breakfast and free stays for kids under 18. Two-room suites include separate sitting and sleeping areas and a recliner or pull-out sofa.

__label__negative	The hotel room was clean, but very limited to towels, and shampoo/conditioner. Microwave was out of date, but the fridge was decent. Service was eh, we requested towels and were told they did not have enough to give. Breakfast was a nice addition, but it was not a buffet style breakfast at all. You receive a little coupon and have to select between 4 meals. It was decent food though. The location was pretty good, there is plenty of hotels around and there was a truck stop across the street that had a Denny's in it. Also down the street was many other food places Wendy's, Golden Corral. Overall, a good stay but I would recommend bringing extra personal cleaning supplies.

__label__neutral	We found the management of Twin Pines attentive to our needs and the facility itself quiet and comfortable.

__label__negative	Upon checking in, myself being an Expedia Gold member and this being a +VIP hotel, I was promised a free upgrade as well as Spa Credits from the Expedia Customer service reps. I've used these perks at numerous +VIP hotels in the past without any problems at all but the manager at this hotel refused to honor anything and gave me and my whole family a hard time. I accepted his horrible attitude and moved on because I did not have a choice since everything was prepaid. Note** Expedia gave me credits after my trip was completed to make up for this and they hadn't had the slightest clue as to why we were treated so badly. Pools were nice and the food was pretty good. Room service is the biggest joke I've ever seen in my life. I called for food one night and it came 2 hours later. Another time I requested a rollaway bed and it came 4 hours later after numerous phone calls and complaining. last night there I called for some liquor because this seems to be the only hotel without any liquor stocked in the room and they said they could only give me 2 beers per person. I said fine and after 4 calls over 2 more hours, the beer finally arrives hot like lava and I was so frustrated with the staff it made me sick. They have this one lady who answers the phones after 9PM and she seriously must have been hating her job because she sounded like the mafia to me and hung up on me. I truly hated this experience and will never ever ever go here again (obviously) and I highly recommend noone else 2

__label__neutral	An average quality Holiday Inn
__label__positive	My husband and I booked a one-night stay here because our daughter was having a baby, but we had to stay a second night. Fortunately the hotel had a room for the second night, just not the same room. The first night our room faced the street, so there was traffic noise with the window open. The next night we faced the parking lot. The bed in the first room was like sleeping on a rock. We like a firm mattress, but this was ridiculous. The second night, the bed was much better, firm without being rock-hard. That room was huge with two king beds and a sofa bed. It could have very comfortably slept 6 people without feeling crowded. Both rooms had a microwave, refrigerator, and coffee maker. The bathrooms were also large, and the second room had a spa tub. During the stay I interacted with four different employees--all very pleasant. Breakfast was good, the usual cereals, yogurt, fruit, waffles, muffins, juice, coffee. The first day they had hard-boiled eggs, but the second day they were out. I missed the protein. There were several restaurants nearby, but we didn't go to any of them so I don't have a recommendation. The parking lot is fairly small, so if you have a large vehicle I would suggest parking in a place where you'll be able to get out easily. Our only complaint was the very poor internet service. The desk clerk gave us an Ethernet cord, but that didn't help. We were here midweek, and the price was reasonable. We would definitely stay here again.

She went out of her way to make sure they could get me a too. At the price that I had booked it for on the 23rd. I was a very nice room for the price of it. I will go back again.
__label__neutral	It stinks in the hallways, but not as much as the rooms themselves. The staff doesn't care about cleanliness in the slightest. There is a bit of a 'take it or leave it' attitude from the hosts. I'd never even consider staying here again, and would do my best to warn my friends to steer clear of this place, also. If there are no rooms available elsewhere in Belle Fourche, recline your seat and sleep in your car. It will be cleaner, and smell better.

The a/c in the room was not effective at all and none of us slept well because the room was at least 85 degrees. Not impressed with the complementary breakfast. It was the most expensive room during our 2-week vacation, and by far, our least favorite. It is in a great setting, however, with easy access to shops and restaurants. Very short drive into Yosemite National Park.

The breakfast had only cold food - ceral, doughnuts, toast & apples. Our son-inlaw had to go pickup breakfast the the family. When we looked out our hotel windows, they have filled the swimming pool with dirt. We would not stay at this hotel again.

Walking distance to downtown restaurants. Free parking. Breakfast offers fruit, bagels, cereals, boiled eggs. We will stay here again on our next trip to Monterey.
__label__very_positive	Great visit and a very friendly staff! The location is amazing and the rooms very clean and comfortable.

__label__positive	We stayed for 3 nights. Rooms are very basic, and without air conditioning it was pretty warm in the room. But for the price we expected and tolerated that.

__label__very_positive	This place was very nice, conveniently located, staff was great, breakfast was good, rooms were nice and clean!
__label__very_negative	I called this hotel directly and they said they had no vacancy for my time frame. The I called Expedia and they came up with what I believe was the worst room in the hotel. I noticed there were no more than a dozen cars at any given time that I stayed there and I saw very few people coming in or out of the hotel . They did not have any regular coffee for the type of coffee pot in the room. After 3 days I removed the DND hanger off the door. They cleaned the bathroom but never replaced the sheets on the bed. The hotel staff was very helpful and some were down right rude. The breakfast consisted of store bought biscuit and gravy and some tasteless apples. The restaurant and lounge in the hotel were closed down. Rooms were over priced. Very unpleasant stay.

__label__very_positive	We initially booked this hotel for one night of a two night stay in Branson. Upon seeing how clean the room was and meeting the friendly staff, we went back to the front desk and booked our second night here. The room was clean. Our 3rd floor room had a refrigerator and coffee maker. No microwave. Bed was comfortable. A/C worked great. Plenty of hot water (caution: very hot water) for the shower. Room did not have a phone, but that was not an issue for us. Breakfast was good included biscuits and gravy, french toast, sausage, cereal, oatmeal, and fruit, very good coffee and juice. Only thing missing that would have made it better would have been scrambled eggs. Staff was very friendly and helpful recommending shows to go see.

__label__very_negative	After a late night with family attending a wedding in San Antonio, we were looking forward to arriving at the hotel to get a good night's rest. Little did we know that a good night's rest would not be happening. As we opened the sofa bed we encountered a good amount of bugs crawling on the mattress. It was easy to see the bugs because of the white sheets. They were definately, without a doubt, bed bugs! Disgusting to say the least. That was where my twin 4yr old girls were going to sleep! Not a chance that was going to happen now! I went to the front desk and they told me the hotel was booked so nothing else was available. I didn't want to stay there period but my girls were so exhausted we all were! It was really late at night too. I was told I would get a discount only after I had asked how would I be compensated for this terrible experience. I still have not received any communication as to when that would happen. This has made me reevaluate the Hyatt standards for sure. This experience was horrible.

__label__negative	Room was spacious and quiet. What bothered me was mysterious white spots all over the comforter. Per front desk, it must be dried detergents .. I had to spell out what I think those white spots were. Then, there were many, many cigarette burn marks on the blanket. I thought, this was smoke free room ! After 2 complaints with photos, comforter and blanket were changed.

__label__positive	The Monaco Alexandria is a recently remodeled hotel in the heart of Downtown Alexandria, VA.Our room was well styled, very clean and much nicer than rooms we have paid much more for in the past. We did not use its restaurant.There were simultaneus wedding receptions going on so the atmosphere was both busy and festive. We parked in a garage only a block away for $12 for one night. Doorman, room service and check in agents were all nice and professional.The 3PM check in time was not altered due to our early arrival but we did not mind the 30 minute wait. There were free refreshments in the lobby.
__label__positive	Didn't really like how the room was set up. They should have flip flopped the room and had you enter into the living room/dinning room area instead of entering into the bedroom. Loved that we had an ocean front view. The staff was very friendly, our room was clean and bed was comfortable. The breakfast the next morning was good. Would definitely stay there again.

__label__negative	Very few amenities and toiletries, noticed to the bed was poorly made upon entry. Coffee outlet did not work, no internet connection even after calling front desk. Work in adjoining rooms created noise. I have had better accommodations even at other Red Roof Inns for less money.

__label__neutral	Hotel Services / Ammenities have a catch....
__label__negative	The hotel is not upto US standards. The room is filthy & smelling. May be ok for young guys to come on trip; but definitely not for a family. Hotel has to make up on the rooms. It is very disappoining.
__label__neutral	The hotel location is great and within walking distance to everything. The service was not up to what is expected for a Monaco hotel. When we arrived, it was raining and we had to wait out by our car for the valet and bellboy to come out. They weren't busy at all; they were just standing around. On several occasions, there was no one available to open the doors or they were just standing around talking. The first night, we had problems with kids in the swimming pool after midnight making noise and running around. We tried to call downstairs but the room phone didn't work so we had to use our cell phone. After the call was made, the noise stopped after a while. The next morning, the toilet wouldn't flush. We advised the front desk and they fixed the toilet and looked at the room phone. When we mentioned all of this to the person checking us out, they comped us for one night of parking. Honestly, we were expecting more than that, but it was a nice gesture. The room was nice but not very big.
__label__very_negative	Bad....
__label__positive	Great value and very clean
__label__positive	Large room and bathroom with all usual amenities. Comfortable beds. Wifi worked fine. Walls were very thin and first room had noisy neighbours so had to ask to change rooms.

__label__neutral	Was going to a baseball game at chase field, so we wanted a close hotel. The staff was friendly and helpfull. Breakfast was very good. Only complaint is about the room. The air conditioner was so loud that it woke us up every time it cycled on. Also, they need to adjust the door handles so they turn when people are closing the door. The handles don't turn, so the only way to close the doors is to let them shut by themselves. They were so loud, with people going in and out all night, it was the loudest hotel i have ever been in.

Shower head very low and was not refitted to accomodate the sloppy reno of granite slab shower walls. Towels are rough like a loofa. Breakfast: barely luke warm coffee. Powdered eggs-not kidding. lousy biscuits. I gave up on eating there. Worker loudly chatting on phone and sitting at table whole time I was there. Never even looked up. On the plus side-bed was comfortable. I wish this review was an exaggeration. It's not. Waste of a free night reward.

__label__positive	We stayed in hotel based on reviews of other travelers. Buy a ticket for airport shuttle (6 Euro) and 1-way bus ticket (1.3 Euro) to Garibaldi Hotel. You can buy tickets at airport public transport info counter. Airport shuttle no 15 stops at Train Station. Along the same road but going in the other direction, you can hop onto public bus no 2 to get to Garibaldi Hotel. Location is excellent as public bus no. 2 stops just outside hotel. This bus took us to Venice Piazalle Roma bus stop in about 20 minutes. There is a grocery store nearby and many eateries. Hotel is run by brother and sister team and they are very friendly. Continental Breakfast spread is wholesome with a good variety, including boiled eggs. One problem for those who cannot climb stairs is that there is no lift. Still Mr Luigi and his assistant helped us to carry our luggage up the stairs. We stayed 4 nights at the hotel before joining the Mediterranean cruise. We came back for another night after the cruise. Though the vicinity is generally safe, there are pickpockets at the Wed and Fri morning market at town square nearby-so one must be careful. We strongly recommend this hotel and will stay again because of the good location and kind people .

We paid quite a lot and was not informed that you need to request a room with a view in your booking, otherwise you will be placed in a room with a view of rooftops. We went down to the front desk and were relocated for an extra 120 euros a night to a nice room on the Regina side with a terrace overlooking the Grand Canal and Cathedral Salutta. The next morning, we were abruptly awakened by drilling and hammering at 7:30 am NOT the sleeping in we wanted so we asked for the manager to see what was going on. Antonelli could not have been MORE accommodating! Not only did he move us to a bigger room in the Europa building (picture what hotels.com ACTUALLY uses to promote the hotel, chandelier, 16 foot ceilings, 2nd floor stand-up balconies overlooking the gondolas) but he also removed the 120 euro surcharge and comped us breakfast. We were impressed. The next morning we were woken up - AGAIN by hammering at 7:30 am! OY! We visited the front desk again and spoke to a different manager, who was equally as apologetic. He comped us another breakfast and lunch in their beautiful restaurant. The hotel is 400 years old, so there is always something to be fixed. The property was clean, very Venetian and the Westin beds didn't disappoint. The location is great, in the high-end shopping district. We would stay there again due to the excellent customer service we received.

__label__very_positive	Came to explore Napa and Sonoma, this was a perfect location to stay. Right in the middle of everything we wanted to see. Breakfast wasn't great, some microwavable breakfast sandwiches and cereal.
__label__very_positive	Wanted a hotel with free parking just outside the city yet easy to get to Florence. This hotel fit that requirement. Our stay was short yet vey nice. Nice rooms, comfy beds and pillows. No elevators from parking or to upstairs rooms but hotel staff moved our luggage for us. Beautiful view from the patios of the hotel overlooking Florence, great place to have a evening cocktail. 2 minute walk to bus line that takes you right into Florence, easy to navigate. This hotel has an excellent location to the city. Very charming hotel, with modern facilities within the room.

I recommend this place to any bride!!!!

__label__neutral	Nice updates but very thin walls. I could hear the man snoring all night in the room above me. Very nice staff, breakfast O.K., would appreciate yogurt with a little less sugar, stronger coffee and some eggs would be nice. For the price and in Tahoe, what can you expect, a chef on hand with a omelet bar would be sweet. Good location for the Shakespeare Festival.

__label__very_positive	Perfect location right at the end of Ocean Drive. Hotel staff was helpful. Beach attendant with the chairs was a little rude (however I am guessing he wasn't employed with the hotel- it was an outside company). Bed felt like I was sleeping on the floor. Only 1 mirror in the suite, and it was in the bathroom (made it a little difficult getting ready for 3 ladies, but we survived). Pool area is secluded and almost like a hidden oasis. Overall it was excellent, I am already looking forward to going back.
__label__negative	I was very disappointed in this hotel after seeing the high score. It was snowing the whole time I was there and the hotel didn't call to have it plowed until AFTER I got stuck. That just isn't safe. The staff was nice enough but I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone.
__label__neutral	Room was nice location, but hotel was in poor shape, there were crumbs all over the night stand, and the furniture was falling apart. Also the bathroom wasn't the cleanest.

__label__positive	Lovely place with great views. Liked the villa style rooms a lot. There are a lot of stairs to climb so less mobile people may have problems though I saw villas that did not require climbing. They can pick u up and drop u off in a small van. Some good resteraunts closeby, one in particular which was deserted had great views and excellent thai food. Can't remember the name.... Something 'moon'. Shops and beach are some distance away, not easily walkable as there are no footpaths along the curved roads where people keep riding along the breakdown lane, taxi is the way to go. Overall a nice place to stay.

Juice machine dispensed water with small amount of juice product. Hot water for oatmeal was lukewarm. Construction going on in breakfast area so front lobby was being used for breakfast. Waffles were great, but no protein options.

__label__positive	Wir buchten das Hotel fr 4 Nchte in der Woche vor Ostern. Der Aufenthalt war durchweg angenehm. Das Frhstcksbuffet war reichhaltig und frisch (allerdings rate ich von dem Rhrei ab). Wenn etwas aufgebraucht war, wurde es umgehend aufgefllt. Vom Frhstcksraum aus konnte man den Blick ber die Lagune genieen. Obwohl unser Zimmer im Erdgeschoss zur Nebenstrae hin lag, war es dort sehr ruhig. Die Einrichtung ist geschmackvoll und zweckmig. An Sauberkeit mangelte es nicht. Obwohl wir nicht den Anspruch stellten, wurden die Handtcher tglich gewechselt. Das einzige Manko war die Temperatur des Duschwassers. Es wechselte stndig von ziemlich kalt zu sehr hei. Erwhnenswert ist auch das Waschbecken. Der Wasserhahn ist ziemlich klein und so ber dem hervorstehenden berlauf angebracht, dass es schon schwierig ist, die Hnde darunter zu waschen. Der Empfang an der Rezeption war sehr freundlich. Leider war unser Koffer nicht mit uns angekommen. Die nette Empfangsdame kmmerte sich darum und hielt Kontakt mit dem Flughafen. Am nchsten Tag wurden wir vom Hotel aus benachrichtigt, dass unser Koffer nun da sei. Gleich in der Nhe des Hotels ist eine Bushaltestelle. Wir fuhren allerdings nie mit dem Bus, da der Weg zum Anleger fr die Wasserbusse nicht weit war. Das Warten auf den nchsten Bus htte mitunter lnger gedauert, als zu Fu zu dem Anleger zu gehen.

__label__positive	I first stayed at this property way back when Holiday Inn had no competitors in Warren. It had been five years since we last booked a room there and we went with Holiday Inn again because they were priced slightly lower than the other hotels nearby and because we had always had a positive experience before. We were not disappointed this time either. The entire property had been redone and tastefully redecorated. Our room had also been redecorated including the bathroom which had granite countertops and new shower fixtures. We ate dinner in the restaurant which was very nicely decorated. The menu offered a nice variety and although the food was not outstanding, it was good enough. My only complaint was that the service was a bit slow at check in and in the restaurant. But I would still recommend this hotel and I plan to stay there again when I return to Warren.

__label__very_positive	I just called to try and book Hotel Olcott as I couldn't find any website or online info and was told this is now condominiums, and not a hotel for short term stays. Disappointing as the location is exactly what I was looking for!

__label__very_negative	Overflow parking lot across the street has shady guys that drink and do drugs around the clock. I took the attached picture out our window at 9:00 am - twice as bad at 11:00 at night when uploading kids and bags. It was unsafe and a dangerous area at night. The hotel smells bad and the staff was rude. Do not stay at this location.
__label__neutral	Staff unorganized. Room wasn't ready. Hallway very hot with terible carpet. Room was very nice.
__label__very_positive	The hotel was great though I would have liked breakfast included. Was in town with limited time as I was just in town to help my son move into his college dorm and take care of any last minute items. Having a free breakfast would have saved a couple as I was hoping to make this the least expensive as possible.

__label__very_positive	My wife I spent our anniversary at this marvelous Inn in Santa Barbara CA. The room was sheltered in a grove of old English Oaks. The Staff were more than accommodating. We my wife I have traveled extensively we rate this BB in the top 5
__label__positive	Clean and comfortable
__label__very_positive	Stayed in town for business
__label__neutral	Customer service was great. Very attentive. No pool and the smoke pit location was at the entrance giving the hotel an awful smell. Continental breakfast fills every need. Location of the hotel is convenient.
__label__very_positive	We stayed at this property to attend an event about 20 miles away. It's close to the highway, which was convenient for us. Room was quite comfortable and had relatively new furnishings. However, upon arrival we were greeted by a large roll away bed standing on end (i.e., it blocked part of the entry and wouldn't have fit in room if it were set up). When I went to front desk to see about having it removed, I had to wait about 10 minutes for desk person who apparently was only staff person on duty and was working desk and dealing with room issues - she went with me to room to remove bed. Also, lobby was a little iffy - lobby restroom was not clean and, there was a carpet runner in the lobby that was really several pieces of leftover wall-to-wall remnants that had been hand cut - a bit tacky and a tripping hazard. Finally, a couple had a huge, screaming fight in the middle of the night, which I found quite disturbing because I was concerned it could turn violent - not hotel's fault but still... Would return but probably only if there is no other option.
__label__very_positive	we ended up not staying due to it mean under construction the rooms were horrible looking I don't recommend anybody to stay
__label__neutral	Moderately priced hotel chain offers a clean, consistent stay and complimentary breakfast.

__label__positive	Everything was fine with the holiday inn. Only thing guy at front desk kinda seemed lost. Haha. And room seemed just a little bit out dated. Other than those little things which did not bother me is it. Great bar lobby.
__label__very_positive	Very clean, well maintained, classy atmosphere
__label__very_positive	Great breakfast which changed each day we were there. Friendly staff. Room was clean and comfortable. Would highly recommend to others. Pet friendly. I was completely satisfied. Don't know what else to say
__label__neutral	Initially nice hotel. Hotel staff very nice and friendly. Valet parking very high 38 per night. No place to park on street except parking garage that costs 15 per night but no in and outs and closed at a certain time. Quick check in process. The room was large and clean. Need some updating but for the price it was nice. Then the AC went out in the middle of the night. I called to the front desk and we were told maintenance would not be in until 7am. Had to change rooms. Went from a larger room to a smaller one. The noise in the room was ridiculous. You could hear traffic and people laughing and talking throughout the night. Informed the front desk and nothing was done about it. No accomodations were made.
__label__positive	Great location!
__label__neutral	We had to switch rooms. The air quality in the first room was not acceptable. It had a damp feel. They were very accommodating though. However, when we got into the second room, it smelled like cheap cologne. We stayed. It was bearable. The breakfast in the morning was okay.

__label__very_positive	I was traveling alone from Amarillo Tx to Pensacola FL to see my new grandson. This was a little over halfway. Loved the hotel, comfortable...felt very safe...had a great nights sleep!
__label__positive	We booked our stay 2 weeks early and got a great rate. When we got there we were told that we had a hot tub in our room! What a great surprise! The hotel was putting up NO VACANCY signs when we got there and we were lucky enough to get a bonus hot tub that we did not request, nor seem to pay for! Wonderful experience in a great setting!
__label__very_positive	Perfectly located in center of Old Town Alexandria, convenient to many shopping and dining options. Hotel was quiet and well maintained, staff was professional and friendly and bed was very comfortable.
__label__very_positive	Great view!
__label__very_positive	Nice people and nice rooms at a reasonable rate. Pet friendly too!! My room was very clean and the micro/fridge was new and spotless. Was really surprised by the double sheeting on the bed which I only expect from pretty expensive motels. Overall it was a very nice stay.
__label__positive	The hotel was a little hard to find. The Best Western sign was low and hard to see while trying to find your hotel by means of a GPS using your street address. I drove around a large block two times. I did not see the street number.

__label__positive	My husband has neck and back injury, and I have a problem with my sciatic nerve. So when we travel it's alway a gamble to find a hotel with a bed that's soft enough that when we wake up in the morning we don't feel like we're paralyzed. This hotel was very comfortable and clean. I also like the yellow paint my favorite color. Made me feel like I was at home. It's a easy 15 minutes to the airport. And close to lots of places to eat.
__label__very_positive	Great place to stay in Houston

__label__positive	toilet was black with mold, everything else seemed clean.

__label__neutral	Room was decent, not what's pictured on website. Wifi was horrible. Only provided 2 packets of single serve coffee. One regular, one decaf Save your money, better value at most best westerns.

__label__very_positive	Clean, comfortable, quiet room. Comfortable bed. Friendly staff. Breakfast was nice - scrambled eggs, bacon, make-your-own waffles, cereal, juice, and coffee - the usual. We did not use the fitness facilities or indoor pool, so I can't address those features.

I will definitely return for business or pleasure.

__label__neutral	Good for one night
__label__very_positive	Amazing staff, location, food and facilities. The care of customers exceeded my expectation and was above and beyond customer service. Food menu for breakfast was phenomenal. Easy to get in and out of town if you get car hire. Perfect coast for the morning or evening jog. Room was specious with great view and great housekeeping surprises. Front desk staff spoke I am not even sure how many languages and went above and beyond when my suitcase didn't arrive. Highly recommended my mom and I this hotel if you looking for classic historic luxury with old school customer service! Nothing but phenomenal experience!
__label__neutral	Nice place to lay your head.
__label__negative	Room was excellent, though weirdly laid out. Was hoping a king suite would have a slightly separated space from the sleeping area. Bed was very comfortable and sheets and comforter were soft. The room was very clean. They provided a pack and play for our baby. Outside the room the hallway was musty with stale cigarette smoke and the hallways were warm and muggy. The breakfast was adequate as a start to the day but below par even for free hotel breakfast. There is no elevator to the second floor so pack light, something we could not do with a toddler and infant and all our stuff for a massive road trip. The night staff were excellent, even helped me carry some stuff up to the room. It was hard to be annoyed at the lack of an elevator when the staff was so helpful. I would recommend as a comfortable stop over but not an extended stay.

__label__neutral	When we arrived we were made to wait for 45 minutes as they could not find our booking even though I provided a hard copy print and a confirmation on my mobile. The room we were provided was 2 single beds pushed together (for a couple) and they refused to change us to another room. Extremely disappointing as we had pre-paid and had no choice but to stay. Room was old and facilities extremely basic. Will not stay again.

__label__neutral	Returned 5th July 2016 - The hotel looks great, the position within the park is excellent. Staff were friendly, The outside of the hotel is lovely to look at. The only downside was the rooms we had 3001 and 3003 they badly need updating and the cleaner was not very good. They just made the bed and put out clean towels. Did not clean round the bath or toilet. When we arrived there were hairs in the bathroom, (not very nice) I removed them after 2 days as I could not bear to look at other peoples hairs anymore.

__label__very_negative	Great experience.

__label__negative	Stayed only because there were no other options
__label__positive	Stayed here during a conference. The hotel is in a shopping mall of sorts which makes it convenient for dining options. The entrance is a little confusing as the taxis are really found on the side of the hotel. The staff was courteous enough and answered questions that were asked. The hotel room was clean and modern. The beds were comfortable. Housekeeping came daily to clean and change towels. I stayed for four nights and had no complaints.
__label__very_positive	Highly recommend. Ended up getting double billed and took several days and multiple people together resolved, but stay was very good.
__label__very_positive	I would definitely be staying here again! The staff was really nice and very helpful! The rooms were so roomy and comfortable!
__label__positive	PLEASENT SURPRISE
__label__neutral	Used as an overnight stay. Unless you know, the access to the hotel can be difficult. The hotel is decent clean, but basic. Room was decent and clean as was the en-suite bathroom. Unfortunately the restaurant was closed in the evening (This may be due to time of year (Early January and small number of overnight guests)). The nearest eatery was a greasy burger bar. I believe there may be better ones somewhere north of the hotel. Breakfast was fine. Staff were helpful and pleasant.
__label__very_positive	Good balance between price and quality. I absolutely recommend this place. It is located in a nice area.
__label__neutral	overpriced and bad
__label__positive	Good location, ok accommodations.

__label__neutral	We chose this hotel for the breakfast. We had stayed here before and it was great. On this trip the breakfast was sorely lacking. There were only waffles (passed out by an attendant who gave ours to another guest twice), not so great pastries and cereal. We weren't expecting 5 star caliber, but we were expecting what we had experienced before. We won't stay again.

__label__negative	The property was very nice. It sits on the water and is accessible to restaurants, etc. Rooms were nice and clean. I would have liked the staff to be a little more engaging/friendly. Not once did the front desk greet me or ask, How is my stay The lobby is small/intimate, so it would have been nice if someone asked...We are happy you found our property to be nice and clean, and our location convenient to the things you needed during your stay. We apologize that we fell short in hospitality during your time here but hope that you'll come back to see us again so that we can show our true Hamptonality as demonstrated in many other reviews....

__label__neutral	Despite being given a one-hour extended check-out time of 1:00 pm, housekeeping began showing up at 10:00 am in an effort to have me vacate my room. After their fifth visit, and many explanations about how the front desk authorized my late check-out, I left at 11:15 am (45 minutes before actual check-out time). I was unable to complete my work for my meetings, and left shaken and annoyed. The desk clerk seemed uninterested in my situation. What started out as a pleasurable experience, ended very differently.

__label__neutral	The hotel was perfect for our needs. My only complaints: 1) The A/C unit rattled off and on all night. Our friends in another room had the same complaint. This really should be fixed in EVERY room, since a good night's sleep is the most important thing when staying in a hotel. 2) The hot breakfast was mediocre. The eggs didn't look very appetizing and it was hard to distinguish between the gravy and the oatmeal.

__label__neutral	Initially, the room was smaller than I expected, but my stay was pleasant nonetheless.
__label__positive	For the price payed, this hostel is located near a T stop(5 minutes walk) which gives you acces to all the city. Very affordable compared to the hotels downtown. Be sure to ask for a newly renovated room. We got a renovated room(2nd floor, 1full bed). Bed was comfy and room was clean. Lobby staff was welcoming and nice. Would... More

__label__positive	We went to Miami for Blackfriday shopping. We were a goup of five friends and decided to book a two bedroom suite. The suite was very nice and clean with a king size bed in the first room and a queen in the second. The living room had a sofa bed with a thin but firm mattress (something difficult to find in any other hotel). The kitchen was well supplied although some glasses were missing and there was no liquid soap to handwash the dishes. Breakfast was good with eggs, sausage, potatoes, waffles, fruit, cereals, etc. The beds were awesome. This is the first time I really sleep in a hotel bed because I usually wake up with my back hurting or my neck twisted, but not this time! The room was big enough for the five of us and all our shopping bags plus 10 big suitcases! I didn't hear a sound all night long (and the hotel was all booked). The location of the hotel is excellent. Real close to Sawgrass Mills and very convenient when going to the Dolphin Mall or Miami Downtown (40 minute drive).

__label__neutral	The hotel was nice enough. We have 2 small kids, and they didn't have much room to move around without bumping into things. We were outside most of the time, so it's not a big deal. We asked for a crib on several different occasions and didn't get one. Luckily we brought our own - so, also, not a big deal.

__label__positive	We had a fun time in Biloxi, the hotel was exactly as advertised, the room in the pictures looked EXACTLY like the room we stayed in. The pool area was a little odd to get to as it was on the roof of the parking garage, but the pool is very nice. They absolutely will NOT let you leave the pool area with a pool towel which means you should bring your own unless you want to travel from the parking garage, all the way across the hotel while wet. The Italian restaurant on site is decent and priced well. We had two rooms on the trip, the TV did not work in our second room for two days. The only channel on the TV showed adult programming at night, which meant since their were kids in the room TV was not an option. To be fair, we called the desk about this once, then complained again the evening of the second day and they fixed it right away after the second complain so most likely they simply forgot about it, but this does not reflect well on the staff. The lowest rating I give the hotel is the staff, other than that its a great stay. The main thing that bothered me was telling a 4 year old who stood there shivering that they couldn't take a towel to the room.
__label__very_negative	Terrible hotel. The beds were super hard. No refrigerators. People hanging outside

The staff were excellent as well as the breakfast. My room was always fresh and cleaned. The AC was a bit loud but it worked very well. I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the area.
__label__very_positive	It was a Good experience, I enjoyed all stay
__label__very_negative	Read all reviews before you stay here!!!
__label__very_negative	The rooms smelled terrible. Burn marks on the tub. Hole in the ceiling. Staple in the sheets. Everything smelled like cigarette smoke in a non smoking room.
__label__very_positive	Great service
__label__positive	The business class rooms are huge and reasonably priced by any standard but especially for Istanbul. There is an ironing board and iron in the room, as well as a good, well stocked coffee machine and lots of closet space. The only minor issues are TV is quite small but has a lot of channels and the WiFi is choppy. There are many outlets for electronics. The decor is pleasing. Nice big bathroom with tub and shower. It is a 30 minute ride by taxi to Sultanahmet and only a five minute ride to the airport in their shuttle. The breakfast buffet is fantastic, clean and has something to please any culture's breakfast preferences from muesli to fried potatoes and numerous breads, cheeses, fruit, and condiments. Staff is friendly and efficient. Highly recommend this hotel.
__label__very_negative	Don't stay here. Unsafe. Housekeeping will allow anyone into your room. Doors were propped open for days. This included empty and occupied rooms. There were bugs around the sink and the tub would take forever to drain. There was a problem with the water temperature. All I got was hot water so taking a bath was rough. Food was OK.... More

I would... More
__label__positive	Not the best section of town for sure! But a nice hotel. The Hampton Inn, here and other locations should upgrade their towels and wash clothes. Seems they've shopped at a KMart closeout for the bath sets they use in all their hotels. Difficult time regulating the temp in the room too. Valet parking is 22 - but don't look for other options...you wouldn't want to park your car in that area OUTSIDE of the valet area.
__label__very_positive	Great hotel, great breakfast, friendly staff, convenient location, and great rate. I was just stopping by for one night on a one-day business trip, but if I had to stay a week I would have stayed here. This category of hotel will spoil the traveler for what you receive for a low priced hotel. I will never understand why more expensive hotels don't offer this much.
__label__very_positive	Stayed here overnight before departing on a cruise to Bermuda. Danielle was a great hostess, facility was spotless. As a Marriott Platinum member, I have high expectations for all Mariott properties, and this facility met those expectations with room to spare.
__label__very_positive	Bridgetown Mill House Inn Langhorne, PA On October 5, 2013, I hosted a rehearsal dinner for 49 people at this charming restaurant. From hors doeuvres to dessert, we received outstanding service and remarkable food. The owner, Kim, actively manages the restaurant, while her husband, Russell, is the chef extraordinaire. They are both friendly and engaging professionals that strive for excellence. They make sure youll have a memorable dining experience, for sure. They and their ...view morestaff do a fantastic job. Kim provided ample, courteous, attentive servers, and bartenders. We didnt wait for anything all night. I just cant say enough about the incredible service and food. GOOGLE the name to see their web site. The pictures look exactly like the restaurant. This is a cool inn. They also have an outside bar that our group enjoyed, stocked with all the liquors/wines anyone could want first class. The portions of food were plentiful, especially the desserts. The dining room was tastefully illuminated while the glasses, dishes and silverware sparkled. Everything is extra clean and inviting. Inside are several fire places to add a romantic ambiance. So if youre looking to celebrate an anniversary, or special occasion, choose this lovely Inn and you wont be disappointed. Entres range from 21 (chicken) to 31 (filet Mignon). A very quixotic atmosphere, I must say. Finally, be sure to do yourself a favor and pretend youre rich - eat here at very reasonable prices.view less

__label__neutral	My wife and I booked trip over night on a Monday. The location and appearance of the hotel were awesome. However, we had a room right on the street and could not sleep in past 8. There were chainsaws, beeping from big trucks backing up and doors slamming from our neighbors. Now, we did sleep with our window open due to the fact that the hotel doesn't have AC. Maybe, ask for a room within the hotel and not around the perimeter. We stayed in 23. The staff was very friendly and even got us an early check-in.

Lights outside the rooms were falling down. There are people that stay at this hotel as residence it looked like. They sit outside the room with doors opened and coolers out front of there room. Pool needed Much attention. Breakfast, forget it. 3 choices of cereal, 1 gallon of milk, and 1 waffle maker. Coffee was watered down we watched staff re-run the grounds for a new pot of coffee!!

__label__very_negative	Not worth 95 dollars at all , a mess .. Small dirty elevators . the front desk person was heavenly though , so nice .
__label__neutral	This is a low cost, low amenity place in rougher area - passable for a night or two. Wi-Fi was OK in room, but not secure. Free breakfast was good with hot and cold choices. Elevators - 1 not working long term, other was barely working, and was vvvvvveeeeerrrrrrrryyyyyyyy ssssslllllooooowwwww. Working one always went down to basement before coming up to first floor to take guests up their rooms ssssslllllooooowwwwwlllllyyyyy. Elevators need replacement - in really bad shape. Too small and buttons don't work. Bldg exterior, pool area need some investment. Lobby, breakfast area in OK shape. The hallways smell like smoke - seems like a roadway motor lodge out of the 70's. Who smokes anymore The rooms are fairly beat up, small beds, small no frill bath, no water pressure. Did have med size fridge and microwave tho.

__label__neutral	The Plaza is standard for a big hotel casinos in Vegas. Our biggest complaint was that there was no coffee maker, fridge, or micro in the room. The TV channels were very limited and the cable box did not function very well. On the plus side the Fremont street experience was directly across the street. On the whole the Plaza is fine especially if you like gambling.

__label__very_positive	Very satisfied. Friendly reception and comfortable room. I stay at many hotels much more expensive that this Holiday Inn and this hotel was just as good as most of them.
__label__very_positive	Stayed for the first time in this area of the country. My husband and I traveled with two small children, and found that the hotel was very accomadating. I was so impressed by the small details that every staff member took to make sure that our stay was excellent. There was someone there with a smile to help load and unload luggage, park the car, and they even took the time to have the crib in our hotel room before we checked in. Not once did I have anyone that was less than professional approach me. I would recommend this hotel to anyone that is traveling and demands a four star hotel for your family.
__label__very_positive	Comfortable, clean, convenient! Will def stay here again.

__label__positive	Shuttle to Disneyland right outside the hotel, very convenient! Wasn't to happy that there weren't any toothbrushes supplied. Pillows are half the size of regular pillows, but they give you 4 of them. Complimentary breakfast left little to be desired, but there's a Denny's next door. Overall, didn't spend too much time in the hotel as most of the trip was spent in Disneyland, but I would definitely return to this hotel for the price and convenience.

The big flat screen TV on the wall was disconnected and there was a smaller, old-school TV on the counter. Not sure what that was all about. But, the hotel was close to family members we were in town to visit, so that was nice.

__label__very_positive	Loved the hotel , very clean and updated - beds very comfortable and pool area clean - nice pool the children had a very good time in the pool . No towels at pool area . Could of used umbrellas . My only complaint is being from a near county I was charged an additional 100 deposit - never stated that when booking , was upset over it at first - but got to say the receptionist was patient with me while I vented my frustration - I was scared to have a hanger out of place or would be charged 100 . But since I know about the 100 deposit if you are considered a local - I will recommend and return to this hotel

__label__negative	The hotel room and service were good. The rooms are clean, the bed comfortable, but the tub was tiny (too small to take a bath) and dilapidated. It stood out. The problem with the hotel is the noise coming from the street. At night a guy sets up a music box on the street and attempts to sing along. The music was horrible and the sound carried into the room as if he was sitting next to me. Despite my complaining, it went on till well after 11 p.m. I was not able to sleep, read or think due to the sound. I know it is not exactly the hotel's fault, but I would of appreciated being given some information about how loud the room was going to be during the evening.

__label__very_positive	Great place for dogs My dog and I love Happy Tails! I take her to the Doggy Daycare, a safe, yet cageless place for her to play all day long... plus if she needs grooming, obedience training, or boarding, it's all under one roof.

__label__very_positive	Very friendly staff. Room was great. Awesome breakfast. Would stay here again.
__label__very_positive	I can see why some reviews on here were not so positive. Over all, the location of this hotel is GREAT! Just steps away from the entrance of Zion National Park.

__label__very_positive	I really appreciate the dependability of Hampton Inns - they are always clean, comfortable, reasonably priced, and the staff is helpful and friendly. At the Hampton Inn Dublin, I gave a four out of five for room comfort simply because we ended up with a room that seemed a little smaller than what we usually get at a typical Hampton Inn (but it was a full hotel with the Virginia Tech home game weekend and we do have 2 adults and 3 kids in our family!) and because the bed pillows didn't seem as numerous and as comfortable as we've come to expect (firstworldproblems, right). Overall, very satisfactory! The kids had fun in the indoor pool, everyone slept well and we were on our way to our destination the next morning after coffee and a tasty little breakfast :)
__label__positive	Great location , however didn't get the room upgrade as a gold member probably because of availability . The front desks could have been more pleasant and need more customer service skills

They gave me lots of tips as to where to go and how to get there they even provided me with a map of Venice. They were also able to sell me all of my transit tickets, including to the airport for my return. The room was comfortable, although small and slightly outdated it was perfect for my needs. I enjoyed the hotel's location as it was much quieter than Venice. It felt very safe for me to be walking around at night and it was very convenient to get to and from Venice as there is a bus that stops directly out front. There are many good restaurants and shops around the corner that are much cheaper to eat at than in Venice if you are on a budget. I would recommend this hotel for single travelers, families or couples. I enjoyed my stay!

__label__neutral	The motel is well located just off I75. the rooms were clean and the bed comfortable. Breakfast was the usual overnight motel fare with waffles, cereal etc. The staff is genuinely nice. there is nothing that separates this motel from a thousand others in its class. It is adequate and a good rate. They do allow pets for a fee.
__label__positive	We were there for Jazzfest, we stayed 4 nights in a ground floor room, the room itself was small but considering everything to do in New Orleans we really just wanted a place to sleep. The hotel itself is old yet boasted newly renovated, which was far from anything we saw there but on another note, the hotel itself is in a perfect area to be in it all yet away from it all at the same time! We loved the location! It was a short walk to Bourbon Street and Frenchman's was literally right out the back entrance. The courtyard was nice and lush and the pool and jacuzzi were also an added bonus. Nights were quiet yet close enoughbto find all the action. We enjoyed our stay and will be back.

__label__positive	Stayed for a weekend (Thurs-Mon) and thankfully the Tigers Football team was on the road so getting a room wasn't hard. It was a great value for the little cost of the room. If you're on a tight budget, this place is great. If you're looking for a resort stay and planning on spending your entire trip in the hotel, this is not your place. Bed was great to sleep in, shower was hot to bathe in. All I needed the room for.

The national chain (more than 800 locations in the U.S.) accommodates traveling families, as kids stay for free and complimentary coffee is available every morning. The rooms are simple--a TV on the dresser (free HBO and ESPN), data port for computer users and a basic bathroom--but at these prices, who needs a whirlpool

I chose not to move and the direct connect worked very well. A very good value and location.

__label__positive	Be aware of the concierge they don't always know where all the businesses are to send you. We lost the whole morning because they sent us to the wrong place and did not get to do the tour. Very disappointing !! Breakfast was wonderful. Watch out for the walk up banks to exchange your money it's like a legal robbery. Half-mile from McDonald's get your waters and cokes from there for a buck Best Buy in town.

__label__very_negative	This hotel is no good. Damage to many of the room ammenidites, including burnt lampshades, stained sheets, missing light bulbs, broken hair dryer, etc... When I told the front desk about the problems, there wasn't anything to be done. I asked if there was an available room in better condition, and the young lady behind the counter stated that all of the rooms are pretty much in the same condition. There even was a water leak that was coming through the walls. Do yourself a favor, find somewhere else to stay.

__label__positive	Old kind of funky hotel but in an amazing location just a minute from the beach and Boardwalk. It's kind of broken down but the staff were able to adapt by providing new heaters that they let us use in the rooms. Also, when we got there they gave us the option to take one big family double room instead of two separate rooms and that saved us 40/night.

__label__very_positive	I have used this charming and cozy little inn for the last 5 years every time that I have to come to Salt Lake City. It may not be fancy , but if you are looking for friendly staff, clean rooms, a relaxing atmosphere at the pool and hot tub, and an overall feeling of safety and coziness and charm---this is the perfect place. It is close to I-15 for easy off/on access. It is next door to a fabulous Steak house (breakfast-lunch-dinner) or fast food is just across the street. They don't have room service (but they have a complete list of take-out/delivery establishments), or a bell hop, or a conceirge, however, the staff have always been able to answer my questions and address any special needs.

__label__neutral	Easy on/off highway, stayed on way up and back for vaca. kids liked the Splash Zone, exercise room at end of July had NO functional cardio equip- 2 treadmills and an elliptical that didn't work and and a run down weight machine. However in early August on way back there was a functioning treadmill at least. Our rooms in need of renovation, but it looks like that is a work in progress, public areas very nice and new. Breakfast was fine, better at August stay. Also, staff were great and very helpful, especially Kaitlin on August 5th evening shift-she was extremely helpful with all my extra requests, thank you!

__label__positive	Bali is an interesting place and we found the locals to be kind, patient and courteous. Hiring a driver and seeing places in the mountains and inland is a great way to view the rest of Bali. The shopping is cheap in Legian but can be expensive in some other areas. The food is varied. We ate Balinese food but western food is available especially in Seminyak.

__label__very_negative	Horrible stay. Hotels.com should have never posted this site. The entire first floor was under construction. It was necessary to walk through to get to check in and get to the elevator. Extremely dusty! I'm still not happy.

__label__positive	Over the phone staff was very helpful, friendly and comforting, when we arrived front desk staff was very helpful and nice! Security and night staff on the other hand had a problem with what seemed like everyone, very rude and flat out told us that if we did not like anything that we could go to another lodge, keep in mind we booked a suite so very loved everything else but the management needs to control comments and overall rudeness of night staff. Rooms were perfect, our stove was fixed in a timely manner! Had a great stay just left a bad taste in my mouth as far as the night staff goes
__label__positive	Great service at the front desk, took care of our needs towels, mattress with a smile. Thanks guys. Its about 8 mins away from monterey town. Parking is scarce at this hotel, for you late nighters, bar hoping tourists.beds are large, bathrooms are also wheelchair accessible.

Then they switched us to another room on the first floor, next to the temporary entrance, and we could hear people coming in and out all night. We will not be staying at this hotel again and no swimming pool.
__label__positive	Front desk person was very friendly and helpful. Answered all questions politely and went out the way to make facilities available. The room was normal size and clean. The pool was heated. (not a spa type of heat but not ice cold either) The pool area is nice and the pool was clean with no overly bleach smell. The breakfast was typical of the hotel standard. Hotel is in a good area, It is beside a Cracker Barrel and there is shopping centers nearby. No problems with this stay.

__label__negative	I arrived, checked in, entered my room. The phone was inoperable, electric to the microwave was not working, and bathroom was dirty. This is not a corporate location and I could tell by the customer service when trying to discuss my issues with them. On the outside it seemed that some out the patrons were local druggies. I did not feel safe at all. Only good thing about the room is the cold AC and tv channels.

__label__positive	This location is middle of Chicago and St. Louis so if you feel too long to drive, it's good location to stay one overnight. The hotel is not fancy, usual one but everything as expected. Nice breakfast as usual Hampton Inn and the lady who was working in the kitchen was very nice and friendly. Receptionist should learn from her.

__label__negative	Air conditioner did not work properly. TV remote did not work all the time. Beds had to be really old. Courtesey continental breakfast was a joke.
__label__very_negative	Americas Best Value Inn has poor service. They screwed me over twice with their Indian Manager. The first time they took my food and put me through a hard time getting it back. The manager Anil P. Motwani was hard to find, I didn't get in contact with him once. When I finally got my food back they kept my chicken. The second time I got screwed over, I check into the hotel around 2 a.m. Saturday morning, the lady at the front desk was not there I had to stand there and wait by tha...view moret time I got tired and went to see if she was in the bar (The Edge) and there she was. She checked me in and I ask her what time did I have to check out she said Sunday Morning at 11 a.m. so Saturday around 2 p.m. they came and told me I had to check out the room and the manager also stated then We never let people stay over 24 hours.

All personnel were exceptionally courteous and helpful, especially the doormen. They also provided complimentary shuttle to Reagan Airport and Amtrak station, which was a nice added touch.
__label__neutral	Hotel a bit dated. Exercise room wasn't functional. Dining room experience very poor. Beds , linens and towels excessively worn. I realize it is a vacation destination and gets higher than normal wear and tear, but overall , it did not meet my prior experiences with the Hampton Brand.
__label__positive	Good Location
__label__neutral	Had a relative in nearby hospital and just needed a bed and shower the next morning. Bed was comfy enough. Carpet was clean. Shower was good. I was pleased. Overall room decor is OLD. Breakfast was plain and not appealing. Would I stay again Probably for the price and location...if I were in the area.

__label__neutral	I was disappointed with my stay at this hotel. My room looked out on a party that was happening in a courtyard outside my window and was very noisy late into the night. The bed was too soft for my liking. Asked for memory foam pillow and it really wasn't memory foam. And to top it all off I left a pair of sandals in the room and there was NO chance they were left anywhere else and they were never turned into housekeeping. Staff was not receptive in finding my sandals. Disappointed

Second room had spider in tub and a drain full of hair. Was told we could cancel and get a refund for two of the three nights. Manager gave us 48 credit and said we were lucky to get that much!
__label__very_positive	Girls' Night Out
__label__very_positive	Careful when booking! My Fiance and I hosted our engagement party at this venue. We we're very excited and reserved half of the venue for 3 hours of drinks and appetizers for family and friends. We are very disappointed with the service that we got from the event coordinator. During the booking process and contract stage she messed up sending me the wrong party information (BEO) and date several times. The night started and there was a miscommunication with the coordinator and the bar staff. For half the event our guests we told they could not order certain drinks from the bar that we had paid for! This was very embarrassing to us knowing that our 60+ guests we're told they could only order bud and bud lt when we had specifically talked about offering all draft beer + bud and bud lt. Secondly we were told we would have our own bartender to take care of our group seeing as there were 60 people at the event. We only saw 2 bartenders behind the bar 3 times that night. Most of the time there was only 1 bartender for the whole bar and had several people mention how long it took to get a drink. Long story short it is a pretty venue but you do not want to host an event here. The service is absolutely horrible. Even after the event when I brought up the issues I figured they would help us out with a discount or gift card and all they offered us was a buy 1 get 1 free coupon to brunch!

__label__negative	Good breakfast.Room had odor & wasn't the cleanest
__label__very_positive	The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. Room was a bit smaller than expected...but very clean. The biggest bonus was the location. A quick walk to the Eiffel Tower and Arch DeTriumph. Don't miss the blinking lights on the tower at 8 p.m.! The street is safe and upscale. It's probably not worth buying the breakfast there as there are so many places nearby that are less money. Overall, we would stay there again if it was just the two of us. It would be difficult to go with a family though.

A huge part of why we loved this venue was Pam Linker. Throughout the entire process, she was communicative, helpful, responsive, and just all around a joy to work with. She coordinated everything so well our day went off without a hitch. The whole staff at the Abbey was really accommodating and helpful, all our guests were really impressed. And the food was absolutely delicious.

__label__very_positive	Weekend in Monterey
__label__neutral	At first I was very happy and comfortable at this hotel. It was spacious and was what we needed. The second day I went to put my son down for a nap and I watched a bed bug crawl across his head. The staff graciously changed our room and offered to wash our clothes. Even though the second room appeared to be bed bug free, I felt itchy for the rest of our stay. Another down side about this hotel is the lack of children's programming on the TV. The only channel with cartoons was Cartoon Network which is inappropriate for young children.
__label__very_negative	Don't stay here.
__label__negative	We booked nonsmoking but the room we were given used to be smoking and still reeked. We asked for a different room. The shower was so low we had to bend over to get our heads under it. The ceiling above the tub/shower probably would not accommodate anyone taller than 6 foot. Very cramped and tiny bathroom.
__label__neutral	Pool was so chlorinated you could hardly see afterwards. Breakfast area was not very clean and bathroom had moldy smell to it. Staff seemed distant and bothered when asked questions. For the high cost of this property I would look to stay somewhere else.
__label__very_positive	The rooms were a nice size and very clean. We had a suite with a stove fridge and microwave. The breakfast was great. Mon - Thursday they also do an evening social with food which is fantastic. The only downside is pool hours. I wish it opened earlier and stayed open later.

__label__very_positive	Avoid this place. If you like wasting money on small spaces this is the place for you. While this hotel is extremely hip and chic it is also a money pit. The rooms are extremely small in size and you can barely feel comfortable in the space. What makes this worse is the insulting 30 per person breakfast. It is ridiculous especially if you are only having one item.

__label__negative	Arrived and heater in the room was broke---didn't even turn on. Maintenance came to fix/replace. Could not fix the unit and relocated rooms (process took almost 2 hours). No room service during events (even though menu/flyer in the room said room service EVERYDAY---in all caps too)---without a doubt misrepresentation. Also misrepresented having a sauna (when asked was told there was not one): http://www.mccamlyplaza.com/amenities.html
__label__negative	The Hotel is decent, the rooms are large...however, the bathroom tub backed up and the water would not drain, same issue with the sink. The air conditioner didn't seem to keep the room cool, it was warm. When we let the front desk know, they did NOTHING to fix the issues. We would NOT stay at this hotel again, it was inexpensive but now we know why it is inexpensive.

__label__positive	Convenient Location.
__label__neutral	Check in took over an hour because they were severely understaffed. There was no breakfast as indictated, we had to find a restaurant. The building was renovated but there was a wrapper stuck to the window behind the currents overlooking the Fremont Experience block. The north wing takes a different elevator than the south wing. The parking garage has its own elevator that you must use which is on the opposite end of the plaza from where the elevators are you must use to get to your rooms. The kiosk to check in for yiur flights was down, but the check in people helped in printing out our tickets in their office. Everyone was polite and professional. Plenty of gambling and place to eat nearby. It is located 25 minutes from the airport.

__label__very_positive	PERFECTO
__label__positive	This is a great place to stay! Very affordable and right on the beach. Rooms are nicely updated. They have a great indoor heated pool and offer a complimentary continental breakfast each morning which is more than sufficient. Our family had a wonderful time there and we highly recommend it.r r The only downside is they don't have a workout room. Even if they had a room with one or two machines and some free weights it would be nice.
__label__positive	not bad
__label__positive	A nice older property which appears to have been renovated. Nice and friendly staff, pleasant decoration colors and good basic features. Beds are a bit firm, and during our visit the humidity was high and the AC units had troubles clearing out the humidity. The room was set to 60 degrees upon arrival which was refreshing from 100-degree heat index but means trying to warm up the room a bit. The bath fan does actually do a good job of pulling air out of the bathroom which seems rare trait at hotels. Overall a good value for the price if you are looking for a small affordable extended stay sort of place.

__label__neutral	I thought the hotel was clean and comfortable. The woman at the front desk was very pleasant and helpful. We loved the shower
__label__positive	Great hotel but staff lack listening skills ...

__label__neutral	Quick stop on my way thru. Helpful, friendly desk staff for a late check in and check out. Hotel is a little tired, but serviceable for a quick rest stop.
__label__very_positive	Happy Traveler
__label__positive	Nice and clean
__label__neutral	We stayed here twice the room was spacious and clean the problems with the hotel are not the rooms. Both stays key cards didnt work when going to the room the first time had to go back down very inconvenient when your tired from traveling. And during our stay they got demagnetized again. Room service got our breakfast order wrong. We left the room in the morning and came back in the evening and the room service breakfast tray we had from the morning was still outside in the hallway it was 9:30 at night! The next night I hung the breakfast order from the door on the little slip provided. In the morning when it was close to 8:30 I checked outside and the slip was still there no one had picked it up. It should be noted it was placed on the door during the allotted hours. Staff when notified were nice and quick to fix the problem. Both stays at this hotel we stayed Friday and sat checked out on Sunday. Our first visit the room didn't get cleaned on Saturday and we left around ten and came back in the evening. Breakfast was ok not really worth the steep delivery fee. The food wasn't the best quality.
__label__positive	The air conditioning in room was malfunctioning and hot water pressure in shower was low.
__label__very_negative	dirty room, nice location, nice staffs, little bit noisy

__label__very_negative	Cheapest hotel on Priceline--just a standard room with no bells and whistles. Easy access from the highway. Great for  basic overnight stay.
__label__neutral	There was no hot water when I showered in the morning. The manager gave me a 60 credit, but it is now showing up on my credit card as an additional debit. I am sure this will be straightened out, but I won't be back.

__label__very_positive	valet parking is $8 & outside, no cover. self park around corner is a garage (ie> roof). it's free the 1st hour & rates aren't horrible after 1hr.
__label__very_positive	Honestly, I have nothing wrong to say about this hotel It was at a great price, good location. I wasn't expecting a resort type thing, just something quick for business up there. It met my standards and I'd definitely go back.
__label__neutral	First room they put us into smelled like mold, and mildew. Perhaps it was because the ceiling was falling through from a 4 foot wide water damage from the air conditioning unit in the room above ours. Once I went to the front desk they did put us into a new room, but this problem should have been taken care of before someone was put into it. A cleaning maid should have made a note that this room was not fit for use.
__label__positive	I enjoyed my journey at the hotel. The hotel was quiet, which is very nice after a day in busy Palermo. The room was a bit dark and the bed not very comfortable (old mattress smaller than the frame) but I had view on the nice garden, which is what I was looking for. The breakfast was nice and you can ask the staff a real coffee (the one at the machine is not very nice). The staff was very nice and helpful, speaking English and French as well.
__label__very_positive	Centrally located
__label__positive	Enjoyed everything The view was breath taking. Loved having your own patio and chairs to have your morning coffee and watch the waves. Everyone was very friendly. We will definitely come back again ! Had a wonderful time.
__label__very_negative	The hotel offers what it should The staff is friendly, the rooms acceptable, and the tv has enough international channels to satisfy foreigners. On the weaker side, the food in the in-house restaurant is just adequate at best, the morning breakfast is weak for a Hilton, and there are no refrigerators in the rooms. The gym is also below par...
__label__neutral	Overall, the room and hotel were very good. Unfortunately, the curtains do not close to block out parking lot lights and the attached bar/restaurant was quite loud on a Saturday night. Breakfast was good but the pool was very small and it shared a glass wall with the main hallway so that you felt like you were on display. Everything looked a bit updated and clean and the staff was pleasant. Be aware that they will ask for a CC for incidentals even if you are prepaid.
__label__positive	Very clean, staff was friendly and helpful.
__label__positive	IT WAS REALLY NICE GREAT GET AWAY,
__label__very_negative	Worst Days Inn
__label__very_positive	Its a nice hotel to spent a couple of days with your date. The hotel has all facilities to have a relaxing and quiet weekend.
__label__positive	This hotel is nice from the outside and inside however if you are unlucky like me, you will end up in a room where it is cooler outside than in. My AC was broken and it was triple digits during the day so imagine what it was trying to sleep in that.
__label__positive	Friendly Staff
__label__very_positive	I genuinely had no complaints while staying here, other than the young kids in the pool/spa area. The parents didn't really watch, and no staff were supervising the area to give reminders about horseplay, diving, etc, so adults were splashed and crowded at times. Everything! Breakfast was great, the beds were comfortable, and our room overlooked the beach (literally steps away). The staff were amazingly attentive (my aunt slid in the bar area and was immediately surrounded by 3-5 staff including the manager, all assisting and asking her if she was ok or needed anything). During breakfast, there was a sweet woman making multiple rounds, checking in on everyone and everything. The food at the bar was great. Our rooms were large and very clean. Despite being on the beach, there was no musty smell or sand in the rooms. Our balconies were great and gave us a free first class seat to the fireworks show just a few hundred yards from the hotel. Definitely recommend this place!
__label__negative	Non smoking room smelled like smoke. Not good.
__label__very_positive	Great resort between Tampa and the Springs, even if you're not a golfer!!! Staff are all gracious and friendly. Wonderful pools with slides and games throughout the day. Five star dining options, or excellent casual options. No need to leave the resort.
__label__positive	4th of july
__label__negative	Not the best experience for the price you pay. I wont be staying here again. Not true to pictures. More outdated. Supposed to have a retro feel, just looks and feels dirty and unclean. Bed is comfortable and tv is good. Housekeeping service VERY POOR. The information desk staff was polite and friendly, location is good.
__label__positive	Pour les petits mangeurs qui se contentent d'un caf croissant d'autant plus avec un enfant, le prix du petit djeuner est trop important. Un prix intermdiaire nous aurait permis de profiter d'un petit djeuner tous les matins mais 19x3 sur 4 jours, on s'est abstenu.

__label__very_positive	We usually stay at chain hotels, but IP provided a once in a while festive atmosphere, kids love it.
__label__very_negative	Horrendous Stay
__label__negative	If you only need a place to sleep and you're traveling with a child or by yourself, then it is adequate. I went with my husband to participate in a race the next day, and I didn't get any sleep. The bed was more of a full than a queen and I kept getting woken up every time my husband moved. The room guests next door entered their room so late, and they were slamming doors and talking very loud and one could hear everything. In the early morning, I was trying to take a shower and the shower head was all messed up, so the water accumulated into a puddle outside of the tub and I had to use my towel to soak it up. We had to share a hand towel, also.

__label__positive	The Econo Lodge provided exactly what I needed. I was on my way from Raleigh, NC to Athens for the UGA football game. It was less than an hours drive. I only needed a good, clean place to get some sleep. The room was very clean and comfortable...a much better bargain than the Holiday Inn Express which would have cost over $100.00 more than what I paid. The desk manager was very personable. I would stay again.

__label__neutral	Not Much Besides Oceanfront
__label__very_negative	Overpriced because of a football game. Holes in the blanket and linens. Bathroom dirty carpet dirty .. Leftover trash in can from previous guest. My son found a bottle top and chewed up straw by the bed side. This hotel is definatly a 40 a night not 200 a night .

__label__positive	Overall nice hotel, clean. Good stay for the price.

__label__negative	decent airport hotel for the price
__label__very_negative	The carpet was very old and several parts were torn. The room smelled like mold. Front desk service was very good. This was not a 2.5 star. It was terrible. I had a bad feeling when we pulled in and half the neon sign that says 'Hampton Inn' was out. I would not recommend this hotel.
__label__negative	There puddles located throughout the hotel that should have been vacuumed up but weren't. The pub furniture had seen better days. The restuarant had no heat one morning for breakfast. Nothing seemed to be working. This hotel needs a complete makeover. The workout facitlies are shared with the local peoples, who buy membership - so competition to use treadmills with folks other than those staying at the hotel. I had a sirlion steak for dinner and it was 3/4 fat, advertised with cajun spices - it had none - tasted as though it was thawed and boilded in water - disgusting. The vegitables were so mushy you couldn't pick them up with your fork. I would avoid this hotel until they do some major renovations!

__label__neutral	The town of Offenbach is a nice town away from the big city yet not too far. It was just a 20 min ride by S-Bahn into the Frankfurt Messe. But the Sheraton Offenbach hotel is an older hotel and is not competitive to other newer 5 star hotels ....i.e. no amenities such as coffee maker in the room etc. and technologically behind as they are charging for wifi in the rooms. They need to upgrade and become at par with the trends of today. I do not plan to stay in this hotel in the future... I will have to find another hotel in this town.

__label__neutral	The room, although fairly comfortable had the sink outside the bath. This created a problem when others were sleeping and someone needed to wash their hands. The breakfast in the restaurant was better than most places we have stayed, even though it was not as good as it could have been. Overall I would only rate this hotel as fair.
__label__very_positive	This was a great place for my brother's family to stay while they were visiting me in san diego.

Cool pool. Near the freeway and nice renovated rooms. I reccomend this place highly.
__label__positive	I stayed 3 nights at this hotel that is located in a quite, very nice and safe part of Paris very close to public transports (metro, bus, train).

We did not realize this until we arrived with wrinkly clothinget and had to pay 50 Europe to have our clothes pressed since the hotel described a smart casual attire always.

__label__very_positive	The hotel and staff are excellent, easy access to the gondola and the view are spectacular. The food a The View was very good. Rooms are spacious and pet friendly. We had a wonderful time, highly recommend this hotel. My only complaint is that that rooms are too hot in the summer and there's no A/C, which is understandable in the mountains, and there are too many bugs to keep the porch door open. They probably need to install ceiling fans to make it more comfortable to sleep.

__label__very_negative	Cool concept, with a hip hotel, crowned by loft-style condo's with great views. Lobby Bar is very trendy, leading into the dining room. Weekend nights, the bar is very crowded. It's a very see and be scene atmosphere. We have friends who have a condo upstairs, and they avoid the bar/restaurant, at those times. They feel they are paying for a public place, instead of a retreat of the privacy of their home. The food is good for woodfire pizza's, but the rest of the menu needs direction. Service is a little confused! The weekend bar crowd is very loud, crude, and one drink wonders who stand around all night. Not classy at all.

__label__very_positive	Awesome experience My wife and I can't get over how amazing this BB experience was! The inkeepers made this BB so special for everyone! They paid attention to all of the little details and the inn itself was top notch! They brought us lemonade when we were swimming in the heated pool and loungin on the hammoc in the HUGE back yard area. The breakfasts were some of the best I've ever had in my LIFE! Karen is like your own personal Martha Stuart. John, her husband, kept us entertained every morning with fabulous tales, and stories of their life and the town. The JUMBO hot tub in the Baily room was so big we could almost swim in it, and the private door to the screen porch and pool was perfect access to the homey and beautifully gardened pool/patio area. After 4 nights here we didn't want to go home. We've stayed in MANY BBs across the country and for 160- 180 a night this was by far the best! There was nothing I'd like to change and nothing either of us could find fault with. It was specail and you really feel like part of the family - like your grandparents are taking care of you while you're visiting their house. OH and the midnight snacks/deserts they leave out are amazing! You even get discounts at local restaurants and a free glass of wine! THIS PLACE IS THE BEST!

__label__very_positive	Quick getaway
__label__very_positive	This hotel was luxuriously appointed, quiet, and had lots of nice amenities (such as the free wine hour, even though I wasn't there to partake in it, and the offer to print boarding passes for you). However, I was disappointed by some very small touches that the hotel didn't provide, such as no shuttle transportation to the nearby (but not near enough) metro station and nowhere to park briefly (without cost) while one checks in. Still, I had a nice stay, and the neighborhood offers lots of interesting things to do and eat.
__label__positive	The hotel was not bad, not great. Room was clean bathroom was clean and well stocked except for soap/shampoo. If you just need to spend a night for not a lot of cash this is the place to stay. late in evening the guests became a little sketchy and there was a couple I the parking area having in their car. If this doesn't bother you I would recommend this site.

__label__positive	Good location if you're staying in Old Town. It was a $15 cab ride to the Gaylord Convention Center and there are plenty of hotels that are an easy walk to the convention center, so I would stay at one of those next time. It was also a $100 cab fare from BWI so be sure to fly into Reagan OR take the blue Super Shuttle for $45.The rooms are a bit smallish and if you are sensitive to noisy AC units (why do people always complain about noisy AC?), then this hotel may not be for you.

__label__negative	The room and hotel were generally clean. Some areas of the parking lot were too dark for my liking, but there were more than enough spaces. About what you would expect for the price.
__label__positive	This is a very nice clean motel with full size refrigerator , dishes etc. Great pool area and breakfast. It is a little pricey but has separate bedroom with a door between rooms. It is near several nice restaurants like Old Chicago about a block away, our personal favorite.Thank you for your comments. We strive to deliver exceptional service daily and it is great to hear when we meet our guests needs. Thank you or your business and we hope you will choose us again.
__label__very_positive	Great stop

__label__positive	elevators were super hot, pool was ok, hot tub would've been nicer if sand was removed, not fun sitting on sand grit. Be ready to hear jets all day long, they are loud Location was great, views were beautiful. Staff very friendly,room was clean and comfy. loved the balcony and breakfast was very yummy.
__label__very_positive	Sogiorno piacevole
__label__very_negative	We atayed at the hotel from 7/3-7/6. The room was old, smelly, bathtub was broken, toilet seat was burned and the water presure was incosistent. Carpet was old and dirty. Room service came one time and just made our beds with all that was in our bed such as cheerios and baby's toys. They did not change our towels or clean the bathroom. Water in the pool was cold. Lot of noise around the pool did not make our stay relaxing. They charged 220 per night. It is such a shame to rip off hard working American people just bc they wanted to celebrate their most important holiday July 4th. This room is not worth 30. Would not recomend this hotel to anyone.
__label__positive	Had a little diff with communicating what we wanted for a breakfast and no salt or pepper with huevos
__label__neutral	Okay, but not great.
__label__very_negative	Do not stay here letting it rott as they are building a new hotel accross the road...its disgusting
__label__very_negative	Low price for a reason
__label__very_negative	Overpriced, small room with absolutely no view, furnishings showed years of wear and tear, small bath with thin towels, very mediocre breakfast. Worst and most expensive hotel we stayed in on a 11 night vacation sleeping in 9 different cities in 6 states
__label__very_positive	My boyfriend and I stayed here for a weekend trip to celebrate my 25th birthday.

__label__very_positive	This is our third time staying in this hotel. It has clean rooms. Staff is very helpful and friendly. Convenient location to restaurants and shopping. Many restaurants to chose from for hotel delivery. Quiet. Free WiFi. Small but decent fitness center. Will stay there again. Like that they don't charge extra for pets.

__label__very_positive	This was my first time at a Homewood Suites. I was surprised by the size of the room and the full kitchen. The extra space would be great for traveling with the family. Hilton standards were comforting. I would recommend this hotel.

__label__very_positive	Pretty good, and good price
__label__positive	Nice stay for us, cheap and convinent. Free breakfest and internet
__label__neutral	The only reason I booked this hotel was for an overnight stay before a flight. The description states they have an airport shuttle. They do not, and have not for quite some time. This meant that I got to pay 15 for a cab fare instead. Also, there are no restaurants to eat at unless you want to drive or walk across 6 lanes of traffic. The rooms are clean and quiet and the facility is in good shape.
__label__very_positive	Book It
__label__neutral	Good location and nice people.
__label__positive	Compared to on-site properties, this one is well worth the short commute to Disney!
__label__neutral	The brunette waitress in the restaurant was incredibly rude on 2 separate occasions. We will not be returning to Mountain Lodge because of her and the way in which the restaurant manager dealt with our complaint - he was completely ineffective. Shame because the reception staff were very nice.
__label__negative	Room was decent with stove, fridge, and microwave. Bed was ok. For the price, i guess i can't complain too much. Overall, not a hotel that I will return to.
__label__very_positive	Cozy and charming in the best way possible
__label__positive	I stay here often during work travel and really enjoy my stay here. The rooms are clean and have updated furniture and flooring. They serve a great breakfast and the staff are friendly and helpful. I recommend this hotel to guests.

__label__very_positive	My favorite and only place I stay when I return to my home town for a visit.
__label__negative	Great Hotel, staff and location, unfortunately the first night a water line broke, the fire alarm went off for more than an hour, and the hotel lobby was partially affected by the water, the staff did a great job cleaning the place and finally back to normal.The second night of my stay, another problem with the water lines, this time, I had NO HEATER, and NO HOT WATER, in a low 30's weather !Again, the staff did what they could, and offered me a refund for one of the nights cost, and whenthey realized that my booking was thru EXPEDIA, told me that they were going to settle the refund with you guys directly, please take a note and follow up with them.
__label__very_positive	Welcome, traveller!
__label__neutral	I was there just a couple hours in the afternoon and the fire alarm went off. I understand it was a false alarm. It was on for quite awhile. I decided to leave the premises and get an early dinner. There was lots of remodeling going on around the entrance. The room was adequate.
__label__very_positive	Everything was perfect. Breakfast consisted of fresh fruit, yogurt, cereal, bagels toast, each day had something different as far as egg, breakfast sandwiches waffles, pancakes etc... The temperature of the pool was perfect and it was clean. The hotel room was just as it looked in the pictures. Front desk staff was quiet and not really interacting. Except for the staff on Wednesday who were all very kind. We enjoyed our stay and would gladly stay again.
__label__negative	Room smelled bad. A/C didn't work. Night clerk had no shoes or socks on. Breakfast - juice watered down. Cereal stale. Coffee was horrible. No condiments.
__label__neutral	I agree with the other reviewers it's not the best hotel but the staff is very nice ..bathroom could be cleaned up a little some peeling paint ..parking lot wasn't ideal but it was ok...I don't think I would stay here again it was medicare not close to walk anywhere either

__label__very_negative	I was not happy with the stay. The room looked bad. The TV didn't work and bed sheets had stains. AC didn't work properly. I will never go back and stay there.
__label__very_positive	Glamping
__label__very_positive	Great Place
__label__very_positive	I called before my flight landed for early check-in and the manager, said to stop by after we landed to see what was available. I arrived about 11ish and in about 10 min he accommodated me. There is a big shopping plaza to include Walmart, Kohls, liquor store, restaurants etc., right across the street. It's about 8 mins from the airport and easy access to I20.
__label__very_positive	Very Nice Accommodations
__label__very_positive	Another Great Stay
__label__very_positive	Our stay at Silver Run Cabins was way too short. Belenda, the owner, was just as sweet and friendly in person as she was on the phone. Beautiful property, and sweet cabins...rustic on the outside, exceptionally clean and well appointed on the inside. We will be back when we can spend more time!
__label__neutral	Not much
__label__very_positive	Great place! Updated rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. AC worked great. Up dated bathrooms are clean and had plenty of hot water. Staff is very friendly and helpful. They even told me where some of the best places to eat were. Believe it or not, they even did my laundry! Reasonably priced and centrally located for several vacation hotspots including State College. It's a quiet place to stay. So if you are looking for a nice, clean, reasonable and quiet place to spend the night, this is the place for you!

__label__very_negative	just needed a place to stay for the night. the room was dirty, the tv didnt work, the door didnt lock well - i put the chair in front of it to block it just in case. And the police arrived shortly after i got there doing a sweep of the parking lot.
__label__very_negative	I am shocked that this hotel is open while it is being renovated. The lobby and hallways are filthy with a very strong odor of mold. The hallways have very noisy industrial fans that appear to be an attempt to dry out carpeting that has been soaked from leaking ceilings. Shame on the hotel owners and shame on hotels.com for subjecting people to such a property.

__label__very_positive	Lovely place!
__label__positive	Excellent place to stay!!!!
__label__very_negative	We chose this Howard Johnson's because we thought it was a reliable franchise, convenient and moderate in price. While conveniently located off the Interstate it was sub-sub-par in quality. The carpet and bedspread were soiled and dirty - we left our shoes on - the ice bucket had not been emptied or cleaned and had bugs in it. And, the bathtub was totally unappealing with a plastic mat glued on the tub floor - we didn't shower or bathe. Needless to say we would never choose to stay here again.
__label__very_positive	It was wonderful and full feeling. I enjoyed the courtesy from the front desk and the house keeping do a magnificent job of cleaning!
__label__very_positive	Great Place to stay in Burlington, NC
__label__very_positive	THE STAY WAS WONDERFUL, THE ONLY THING I WOULD CONSIDER DOING IS PUTTING MICROWAVES AND MINI REFRIGERATORS IN THE ROOMS.

__label__very_positive	Perfect stay!!
__label__neutral	Sink was overflowing. Freeway noise if u open window.
__label__neutral	The hotel staff was very warm and friendly. They tried to give us adjoining rooms as requested but found a beetle in one of the rooms and my daughter did not want to stay there (even after the bug was killed). They moved us to another room across the hall. The room was tight with the beds right up against the walls. The pictures from the website made the room seem larger than what it actually is. The bathroom seemed a little rundown but for one night and the price we paid, it was worth it.
__label__positive	Comfortable rooms

__label__positive	De los puntos a mejora es la puerta del bao si abriera hacia adentro seria mas practico, ya que abre hacia afuera y si alguien esta en el labamanos es complicado salir. Dejamos un recado en la habitacion que la secadora no funcionaba y no fue atendido. Por todo lo demas fue una estancia agradable.

__label__very_positive	We have stayed at the Humboldt House Inn for years when traveling to or through Garberville. Best value in the area. The adults enjoy the wine and cheese each evening while the kids enjoy the pool. The complimentary breakfast may just be the best I have ever received at any of the places we have stayed .

__label__neutral	Very disappointed in the room. Expected more after reading other reviews. I thought the place was starting to show its age, the bed was not comfy, pillows were small and not very fluffy. No microwave or mini fridge in room. Staff was very friendly though and breakfast was very good.
__label__positive	Wet floor
__label__very_negative	Upon check-in the gentleman at the front desk had a hard time figuring out how to put two cards toward the room (we split the cost of 6 nights in a 2bdrm suite with my mother). He had to ask for help, which is fine, but it took forever and this incident came back to haunt us. The carpet was disgustingly filthy in our room! We all had black dirt and grime under our feet after only 2 hours of being in the room! The dishes in the cupboards were all dirty. ALL of them! It was so gross. There was dried food on everything. Check out was a nightmare for my mother. The two people working the front desk at check-in did not swipe our credit cards correctly and there was no record of my card ever being swiped. Which is INSANE because we actually saw them do it! At this point my family and I were already on an airplane home, so my poor mom had to check out alone and deal with this. They put the entire cost of the room on her credit card because there was no record of my card. We aren't a rich family. We saved for a very long time to afford this trip and in one swipe this Residence Inn completely ruined my mother financially. Even after admitting it was their mistake the hotel manager never offered my mother any sort of consolation. No discount, no coupon for a future stay, nothing. They just shrugged their shoulders. They've lost customers for life!
__label__very_positive	Wonderful stay with family for a ski trip in March. The indoor pool is the best way to unwind after a day on the slopes. The service is AWESOME. I left personal belongings in the room and they mailed them back to me promptly. Property is a little funky and outdated but if you get a room on the 2nd floor, you won't notice too much. Wish they had microwaves, but overall, I will return!!
__label__very_positive	Take the glass high-speed elevators all the way down to the lobby.
__label__very_positive	We were thrilled with everything from the cleanliness to the top notch breakfast to the kindness of everyone but, the very first person we met. She was the first person we approached behind the counter when we arrived. Later we learned that she was handling both the desk and the Housekeeping roles that night. If I were to judge the facility by this one person, I would have been disappointed in her lack of hospitality in answering our questions: no smile, no patience...cranky. However the rest of our stay, and we did add an extra night, more than made up for it. This was my first getaway in 4 years on ANY kind of vacation/family celebration, so I was really hoping for a good time. I really enjoyed the cleanliness, as I own a cleaning service here in MD. Thank you so much for an overall excellent stay!!!

__label__negative	It was a room with a horizontal sleeping surface.
__label__positive	Reasonable hotel. Clean and comfortable. Good location, a couple of blocks off of US101. Less than 10 minutes drive (traffic aside) from South Murphy Street with lots of restaurants. Two things stand out for me: They had high quality coffee maker at breakfast which was pleasant the room windows open and had screens which was nice since I like to sleep with the window open.

__label__positive	This was the preferred hotel for a wedding I attended in September with my family.

__label__neutral	Phone and internet signal extremely weak. Room has refrigerator and microwave. Very close to grocery and shopping. Much more reasonable cost than most other hotels at the time.

__label__neutral	Hotel ligt pal naast de Dom en het station.Veel kamers liggen aan de zijde van de cafs. Geeft veel geluidsoverlast. Ook kan de staat van onderhoud van enkele kamers beter. Ouderwets is niet erg. Schimmel in de badkamer wel. Ook is de watervoorziening in de badkamer onbetrouwbaar qua temperatuur. Hotelier is wel zeer attent, vrolijk en service gericht. Ontbijt is bijzonder goed. Zeker gelet op de prijs.
__label__very_positive	Great place to stay.
__label__very_positive	"The Hotel Monaco was an excellent choice in a superb location. Originally booked our mini vacation for 2 days and extended a day longer. We didn't want to leave!!! The hotel is located right in the middle of Old Town and everything was within walking distance from the hotel. We were also traveling with 2 dogs and had no problems with them during our stay. My only complaint is the lack of grass for the babies to go do their ""business"" in around the hotel. We had to walk a couple blocks up to this one strip of grass for bathroom breaks. There are parks down by the water, but for late nite runs it would've been nice if we could have taken them to the courtyard for a quickie. Maybe they can invest in remodeling it in the future to accommodate their pet friendly status. Overall, it was an excellent stay with beautiful rooms and a very curtious and helpful staff. Highly recommended!"
__label__positive	Stayed for one night with two teenagers while on a trip to Fitchburg for open house at Fitchburg state university next day. Beds were comfortable, room temp was good, bathroom clean, so overall pleased with the room. Breakfast was great especially their waffles.
__label__positive	Hotel located in South Beach Miami right on the Ocean drive. Very close to many restaurants. It is right on the beach. Benefits: quiet, but still next to crazy Ocean drive. Right on the beach. Has kitchen available by request. Nice pools. Nos: There is no parking in the hotel, valet parking 30 a day. Hotel is older and not luxury. Overall best choice for the South beach location.

They did comp the parking but at the same time said that you should not believe the Internet and call the hotel to be sure... What Are you kidding Your not suppose to trust the people who sell the rooms Oh well, after that point everything was really terrific and great. The hotel was great. The breakfast there was great too - particularly a guy named Leo who works in the restaurant. He is terrific and not just to me and my family but to everyone as I watched him do his work. I would definitely stay there again.
__label__very_positive	Best Ever Plus

__label__neutral	The propoerty is fine, located in a safe place near the interstate - very conveninet location. The staff was rude and incompetent. In particular the cleaning staff did a poor job and were seen every morning grazing at the complimentary breakfast buffet. I don't really have a problem with the Hotel feeding their staff but to have to wait for quite a while for the staff the quit chatting and get out of the way seemed extreme. Also, one of the mattresses was VERY poor - like sink down and hope you find your way back out, poor.

__label__positive	Terrific, classy, and Chic Hotel Close To Everything Atlanta I have enjoyed both single rooms and suites at the hotel. Both were very nice. The hotel lobby and common areas are well designed and very welcoming spaces. Finding your way around, finding the front desk, finding the elevator are all easy and just short steps from one another. The rooms themselves all have full kitchens, granite counters and very spacious. There is a sitting area with desk and flatscreen television as well as computer. The bedrooms are separate also with flat television. The beds were well made and designed and very comfortable. Along the back wall is floor to ceiling windows and because the rooms are designed with a loft atmosphere these windows are huge, perhaps 16 feet high. I loved the design of these rooms. The furniture was well chosen and the ambience was so loft like as well as home like that I was instantly as ease. Check out the Lobby restaurant and the street scene called Atlantic Station.

__label__very_negative	it was so horrible we decided to just leave and spend the next hour trying to find a different Hotel. we had a late check-in due to a wedding and when we got there we had to stand outside (check-in window) where a bunch of people were hanging out which made it very uncomfortable. we were promised a bottom floor because of my wife's medical issues but they said there was none available so we got a second floor room where there were also a bunch of people hanging out staring us down if we tried to get through the stairwell. when we got in the room the nightmare began. the bed looked like someone had just gotten up from it. It wasn't made and the pillows were tiny and the sheets and blankets and pillows are all extremely dirty. The shower had hair all over it as if somebody just took a shower and the whole room had a very very strong Smokey musty smell to it that made it very difficult to breathe. I swear I'm not exaggerating! Also, the door looked like it had been broken into many, many, many times and the chain lock had several holes where it was obviously remounted several times , and the mount that was up was barely held in by one screw at this point. and it was bent all out of whack too! we're working on trying to get our money back from hotels.com but, nonetheless, we're glad we left and found something else.

__label__positive	A good value for the price. Room was very clean,comfortable and fresh smelling. Megan at the front desk was especially cordial and helpful. The motel is very close to and parallel to I90 so the room was a bit noisy into the late evening. I would recommend requesting a room on the other side of the motel.

__label__positive	This is a nice resort town hotel. The pool is a nice area but in real need of cleaning. I saw reviews earlier of the pool needing cleaning and thought that it would of been done. This is the only complaint and the reason for the lower number on condition of hotel. Room are modern and large comfortable beds to. The breakfast there is great. Big variety and selection a really meal. Casino is not even 5 mins away by car and easy to drive to. There a little bar/grill right across the road which was nice.

Because of that incident we were all tired in the morning and my daughter forgot her favorite bear ""Algonquin"". We called immediately after we realized it was missing. The bear was not found and we know it was left close to the bed. We could only hope that it was passed to another girl that will love him as much as my daughter did."

__label__neutral	In the area to compete in a motorcycle race and needed a clean, reasonably priced place to stay for a couple of nights. The hotel was clean, recently renovated and comfortable. It is a no frills sort of place and don't expect a lot for breakfast other than cereal, the token waffle maker, coffee, milk and juice. I was happy with the hotel for the price and would use it again if in the area.

__label__very_positive	We stayed at the Simpson House Inn as a special treat for a milestone birthday. From check in to check out it was the best experience we have ever had. We were met on arrival by name and had a lovely room with our own private balcony (the Sun Room). The gardens are just lovely and perfect for relaxing with a book and a glass of wine. The Inn puts on a complimentary wine tasting with canapes, and does a lovely breakfast as well. I cannot recommend this Inn highly enough. Stay here!

__label__very_positive	This is a standard Holiday Inn Express, I really liked the location. It was an excellent value, breakfast was great.
__label__positive	The staff was very nice. The staff had fresh baked cookies at the desk every night. I thought that was an awesome touch. I have been to many hotels and no other hotel has done that. This hotel was very clean. The only bad thing I would say is the room could use better lighting.
__label__positive	Everybody was super friendly and wanted to accommodate our needs. The breakfast was delicious!!
__label__positive	The Internet just doesn't function in your room here during peak times and my hotspot won't pick get a strong enough signal either
__label__very_positive	For good old fashioned, friendly, comfortable accommodation, you can't go wrong with this Econo Lodge. Right off the I-94, close to good restaurants, and easy access to the rooms themselves, this is a great place to catch a good night's sleep on your way to wherever. The owner/operators are friendly folks, and they are helpful with recommendations and fast check in/out. Looking forward to staying again.

__label__neutral	Enjoyed our stay with family. The location was fantastic with lots of shopping and restaurants nearby. We had to change rooms after we checked in due to faulty air conditioner in original room. Cable TV channel selection seemed to be very limited compared to other hotels in this price range. Sofa bed cushions were getting pretty flattened and need to be replaced.

__label__positive	Over Crowded
__label__very_negative	We had the room facing the street, and above the lobby at the top of the stairs. It was noisy, and our room smelled like it had not been used in many years, and like smoke. Twice during the night someone was using their card to try to get in to our room. The one guy said that he had been using the same room for a long time and then we resorted to telling him we were calling the police. Then he left us alone. The continental breakfast was a danish and an apple..I would not stay here again.

__label__very_positive	CLean hotel!!
__label__positive	I like Hyatt Place as a concept hotel. The rooms are very well laid out and comfortable, plus offer a good work area. Breakfast options are very good. I like the informality of staff and lobby area. The area surrounding this North Point property could not be more convenient for someone on the road.
__label__positive	Very high resort prices for any lodging around Big Sky or West Yellowstone. The studio apartment/room I was in would be fine for one person or a couple, and has all kitchen facilities needed for housekeeping while staying there. The shower wasn't too clean, and I had a little trouble figuring out how to make the Murphy bed - top bottom sheets on the bed, comforter sandwiched between two sheets in the closet. Great view (9th floor). Seems like the high price should include breakfast, but I suppose the kitchen facilities (which I didn't need or use) prevent that.
__label__negative	There was security block by the bank I used, therefore the hotel could not charge the fee to my card so the manager kindly called to confirm which I appreciated. But the manager complained me by saying that if they would cancel the booking if my card couldn't have been charged!!! So I had to say sorry. Then when I checked in, the hotel staff repeated it again. Later, I knew it was 204/night on Saturday and Sunday but if I stayed one more night it costed 89. The ac compressor during the night was so loud.
__label__very_positive	This hotel was very clean, cozy and perfect for the price. Breakfast was delicious and the staff was very nice. Always greeting us in the morning and always willing to help. The gym and pool was very nice and clean. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family. My family and I felt very welcome and safe during our stay. Very positive experience. :D

__label__very_negative	I must say, I really had much higher expectations for the hotel. Once I got to my room, I noticed how outdated the whole place was. Also, the place smelled like orange cleaner that was masking a funky odor. Honestly, it felt like I was at a nasty roadside motel. I will say most of the staff was somewhat pleasant. If given the choice, I would of rather stayed on a couch at a relatives house.

When I went to the front desk the attendant was eating and with a full mouth she told me that housekeeping had not learned how to use the new machines. She handed me dry towels that were probably as old as the hotel, they were thin and with holes in them. One was even blood stained. As far as cleaniness is concerned the room was filthy. There had to be years of build up of cob webs around the heater. There were pieces of the ceiling on the floor and the bathtub was cracked and stained. Their idea of a continental breakfast was a rotting apple that was in the basket for 3 days and a couple of stale pieces of bread. The hotel was rated a best value and it was far from that. Even at 58 dollars a night it was far from a value. DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL!!!!!!
__label__very_negative	Wow! We were so excited for our first trip to Telluride. After looking at many properties online, we went with this one. Called to make reservations because I had questions before booking it online. When I spoke to an employee, he told me not to book online because he could get me a better rate if I called the day...

__label__very_positive	Best La Quinta I've stayed in
__label__positive	Great Stay the Beach!
__label__very_positive	Overall it's good stay. It's close to highway which is good for us because we are on the road. Room is clean and comfort.
__label__positive	Nice hotel. Beautiful grounds. You can park the car for the whole trip and walk to Zion and restaurants. The beds are very comfortable and there is enough space in the room for you and your luggage. Only negatives are WiFi needs improved and would be nice to have breakfast earlier.
__label__positive	NOT FOR MID AGE COUPLE WEEKEND
__label__very_positive	loved it , would stay again
__label__positive	Stay was generally fine. Room is a tad rough around the edges, i.e. worn (hole in bedspread), but room layout/set up is good. Staff was very friendly.
__label__neutral	We chose to stay here at the last minute, so we wouldn't have to make the two hour trek home following the comedy show we were seeing at bankers life field house. We picked this hotel because of the price and not entirely negative reviews. It pretty much lived up to its reviews. Not a great location, tucked between a wal mart and a lowes, with limited parking and a dimly lit parking lot. our room was fine and the bed was relatively comfortable. I didn't sleep well, but I blame myself for not bringing my own pillow. I can't sleep without a pillow, but I need it to be pretty flat, which hotel pillows are notoriously fluffy. My husband didn't sleep well because of the air conditioner. It was incredibly loud, which we both liked, because it drowned out the other noises in the hotel. Unfortunately, whenever the AC shut off, it was jarring and woke him up repeatedly. My only other complaints would be the room doors, which slam no matter how you shut them and the breakfast buffet, which is a healthy eaters worst nightmare (unless you can be sustained on mealy apples alone). To summarize, you get what you pay for. But this was by no means a terrible experience.

__label__positive	I was there for a concert at the Senator Theator, which was walking distance from this hotel. The neighborhood was quiet for a college town. And the hotel had everything I needed in it. (Mini fridge, microwave and iron) The staff was nice and worked with us when we had car troubles the next day. It's a nice little place.
__label__neutral	Good price for the area
__label__positive	We were in town for a week of bicycling. The hotel was nicely maintained and the staff very accommodating, especially for cyclists. We had a king room and it was spacious. The room was not noisy, but for future visits we would request a room on the side opposite the highway.

__label__very_negative	The familiar sign promises economy, consistency and no surprises. In ShortSince 1962, travelers have enjoyed budget-friendly prices at Motel 6. The national chain (more than 800 locations in the U.S.) accommodates traveling families, as kids stay for free and complimentary coffee is available every morning. The rooms are simple--a TV on the dresser (free HBO and ESPN), data port for computer users and a basic bathroom--but at these prices, who needs a whirlpool

__label__very_positive	A pleasant surprise beginning with a great check in experience. Older but well maintained and very clean. Staff was friendly and helpful. A comfortable, convenient place to stay at a good price.
__label__positive	We stayed two nights here over Labor Day weekend for our visit to Astoria and Seaside. It is reasonably close to both locations (within 45 min and an hour of each) and was significantly more affordable than any hotels in our destination cities. The rooms were clean and all amenities were in working order. The tv had cable, though it was not a new flat screen. The continental breakfast provided sausage patties, homemade biscuits and gravy, oatmeal, yogurt, waffles, juice, coffee, tea and cold cereal. Warm foods were kept in slow cookers and the breakfast area was in the front room. Reminded me a bit of a family housing lots of friends - very homey. Cleaning and towels were taken care of professionally. This was a good and pleasant stay at a budget price - not a pricey resort by any means, but quite comparable to Best Western and the like.

__label__very_positive	Wow this hotel has it all, staff were nice, rooms were as shown, clean and neat. I suggest if you want to stay there, you should book at least two nights that's a minimum. Water park is a must visit and theme park as well. The hotel already have pools also but the water park is very enjoyable for kids and family... Water park closes at 7 am and theme park closes at 12 am... I would highly recommend this hotel and going to both water and theme park... Expect long lines and give extra time for check in (you will need at least an hour to do the check in for hotel) that's on week days... Nice nice vacation

__label__very_negative	Our non-smoking room contained an ash tray and smelled STRONGLY of cigarettes. We informed the front desk but were told no other rooms were available. They had turned away many folks with reservations that night, so we were told we were lucky to have a room. Wow! The closet door was broken. The sink was broken and contained standing water (my husband fixed it). The topper The bed linens had NOT been changed. They contained hair and questionable stains. We had arrived late in the evening, and we were exhausted from two days of driving. It was so disheartening to arrive at this mess. We attempted to find other accommodations for the night, but no local hotels had any vacancies.

Great location, moments off I70. Starbucks, McDonald's, KFC, Walmart, plus others in walking distance. Wish all Super 8's could be this nice.

__label__positive	Thought it was a real nice place for the price, plenty of basic things to do within walking distance of hotel. Would stay there again.
__label__positive	We chose Hotel An Der Philharmonia due to its convenient location, being close to local Restaurants, bars, shops and the Rhine (ideally situated because we'd booked to go to an outdoor gig at the Rhinepark), and the hotel has a good overall star rating. We arrived on an unusually hotter day than normal for the time of year - around 30 degrees C on the Sunday before August Bank Holiday Monday! The hotel unfortunately does not have air-conditioning, and with our room being on the top (4th) floor, it was quite stuffy. Fortunately, there was a standalone air cooler in the room that was running, and we opened up the windows to cool ourselves down. It is for this reason only that we did not give Room Comfort and Hotel Facilities a five star rating. We'd asked for a quiet room, and that's what we got, being light sleepers. We had breakfast at the hotel, which we enjoyed, thanks to the variety and quality of food available. The hotel staff were friendly and courteous, which is one of the main reasons why we would be happy to stay there again, and recommend the hotel to anyone looking to stay in Cologne, or as a base from which to take day trips, being as the railway station is nearby.

__label__very_negative	This was a terrible experience. It was prepaid because we were arriving late. The hotel was filthy. It had ground in dirt. The carpet felt grimy and sticky. The lamps had dust and cobwebs in the design on the lamps. The hotel smelled of some type of rotten type curry smell. I thought the room would not have the smell but the door had gaps all around it. I could see the hall lights all around the door when it was shut and locked. It was late and we were very tired so didn't push for a refund etc. I would never stay here again.

__label__negative	Worst BW i have ever been in.
__label__very_negative	Hallway stank of cigarette smoke. Stayed on Second floor, with rooms on same floor that were smoking. Why any Hotels still allow smoking in 2015 is beyond me. Room was clean, but old. Beds were comfortable. Clerk Lady was nice and helpful. Continental breakfast was not up to par. I've stayed at a few Super 8's in the past, and usually they are older but not to bad. This one was the worst. The air in the overall common core are of the building was stagnant and wreaked of smoke.

At 1:52 am in the morning someone near to us kept banging on the door louder and louder. In another room a lady was yelling. Then in another room they kept going in and out letting the door slam shut over and over. This went on for quit awhile (30 minutes plus). The moral never stay on the ground floor
__label__negative	Overbilling
__label__negative	The hotel charged additional fee for persons over 12 years old. The hotel did not provide facial tissues. The previous hotel guest left his watch in the room. He phoned back to ask us to look for the watch. When we found the watch, I informed the hotel staff and asked that they return the watch to the patron.

__label__very_positive	Better than Home for the Holidays! They say there's no place like home for the holidays, and that may be true. But The Bailey House is BETTER than being home for the holidays! Talk about stress-free holiday enjoyment. Karen John decked the halls (and the windows, the mantels, the jacuzzis and every corner of the home) with gorgeous holiday decor inside and out. It was reminiscent of the scene in a Chevy Chase movie with the line - cue the deer! as the graceful whitetail deer wandered the edges of the property in the sparkling blankets of snow. Serenity and delicious homemade cookies among crackling fireplaces - It just doesn't get any better than this. Books and magazines for every interest. For an escape from everything stressful - this is the place to choose.(Our second visit and we'll be back!)

__label__very_negative	Wouldn't necessarily recommend this hotel unless you need to stay somewhere cheap. You will definitely get what you are paying for though. Our room had the overwhelming smell of fresh paint. There was also a dirty diaper in the bottom of the swimming pool and we noticed it after we had been swimming in it for a little bit. The hot tub is really gross and dirty and needs a much needed scrubbing. The only good thing about this hotel is that it is quiet and the breakfast was decent.

__label__very_negative	This hotel looked good on the Expedia site, so I booked it. When I got there the rooms were in terrible shape, by far the worst hotel I have ever seen in my life. The room was filthy, cockroaches everywhere, the furniture looked worse than garbage picked up off the street. I am not kidding, every room was worse than the next, not what the picture shows.The service was even worse, no towels, no soap, no trash cans, my bed was literally broken in half, not one time in the 4 days did anyone come to clean my room.

After a nice walk with no problems we went back to our room and decided to get in their hot tube. Oh my, a big hot tube that was heated to 101deg with many jets. We melted in the water.

__label__positive	Nice inexpensive room in a very affluent area. Decent breakfast and helpful staff. Room was simple but clean and functional. You are in Tahoe, you should be out and about enjoying the beauty and not in your room. Only downside, which as not the property's fault, was the drunk, obnoxious wedding party that came back to their rooms and woke the whole property up with their own personal Jerry Springer episode and with the headliner in the room right next to us. Sheriff was called and took care of the situation. The employees were notified the next morning by all and they were extremely apologetic. They have a no party clause with fee when you sign in, hopefully the property enforced it.
__label__very_positive	Hotel and staff were very good. I was able to check in early. Loved my warm cookie that I was given. Room was clean and smelled cleaned and crisp. Check out went very smooth.AC in room was not cooling properly though.
__label__very_positive	Have stayed here many times and really like this place. The staff - particularly in the restaurants - is wonderful.
__label__negative	Under renovations. Seems like they cater to the trucking crowd! Could use a spruce up around the outside. Should put in a smoking area so it doesn't appear that people are lurking around. Price was right. They need to update bedding as it looks worn and dirty even when its clean. Might want to look at new mattress also.
__label__very_negative	Rooms very hot , air conditioners Not working . Requested service at customers services desk with Rene ---- Never came to check on rooms , Casinos Resturant service good But rooms old , worn out and hot
__label__very_positive	I had researched hotels/motels with parking before booking the Chelsea and it appeared the perfect fit. Once booked I was concerned by the comment parking on a first come first served basis as I had been warned parking is at a premium in the city. My fears were unfounded as there was plenty of room when we arrived. The rooms... More

The hotel is older but it is maintained well and kept exceptionally clean. I was greeted with a smile (and a bottle... More
__label__very_negative	I found this hotel to be very clean and most of all very secure. The rooms were clean, well air conditioned, and the bed very comfortable. The pool was warm and inviting and the exercise room very well appointed. The only issues I have were a slow flushing toilet and my view of the Power Chicken sign was obstructed.
__label__positive	Easy access to the fairgrounds and citrus bowl.
__label__very_positive	This hotel is surrounded by such beauty! The room was amazing and very close to a gondola to get to all attractions and restaurants! This resort is surrounded by trees and greenery. I would most definitely go again. I heard thatbit's amazing in the winter for skiing! if you ski, I highly recommend.
__label__very_positive	Awesome hotel to stay
__label__very_positive	Great stay
__label__very_positive	Telluride is an incredible town, but staying on the mountain with the ski in and ski out accessibility is key to maximizing our ski time. The pool/jacuzzi/lodge is nice to have after a long day of skiing and the ability to sled after ski hours made this spring break trip all too fun.
__label__very_negative	The staff and facilities are amazing. The food is prepared by a chef and room service comes really fast. I love using the fitness room and the pool and it's always clean and open. Thank you for another great stay at the Princess.Dear Gulaine W, thank you for giving us a few minutes of your busy time and give us your comments on your stay, for us is a really important gesture because it allows us to know your opinion and satisfaction you get along with our service. Please if there is something I can do for you, do not hesitate to...
__label__negative	Lobby was modern, staff was super friendly. However...room was low standard. Fire Alarm was laying on the counter. AC was set at 72 and the suite bedroom was unbearably hot. We set it to 60 and left for 2 hours...still hot but tolerable with the ceiling fan. Not enough towels or wash rags. Loud screaming young kids in the pool until 10;15pm on Thursday night. Room needed updated 5-10 years ago. Breakfast was average. Super staff, though.
__label__very_positive	We stayed at this Drury Inn while visiting family. It was a nice stay. Had no problems and staff helped you no matter what time it was. Unfortunately we left a day earlier than planned due to nothing to do. But, the lady at the front desk had no problem returning our money. I would stay here again.

__label__very_positive	Upon arrival staff was very kind and courteous. Rooms were very clean and crisp. Complementary breakfast was great...we enjoyed every minute of our stay looking forward to visiting again soon. Thank you Hampton inn (Tucson)
__label__very_positive	I recently stayed at your hotel with three of my co-workers. We had a wonderful time. The location of the hotel was perfect for shopping. My only advice would be to avoid the hotel's restaurant for breakfast; it was too pricey and the food was just average.
__label__very_positive	Quick one night stay, comfortable with good free hot breakfast.
__label__neutral	Decent morning breakfast starts at 6am
__label__positive	Good overnight stay
__label__very_positive	Good Accommodations
__label__positive	Nice hotel, but the double queen was way too small. The bathroom was really close to the bed and the closet was not very usable in the corner of the room. No floor space. Fine for one or two people, but not for three or four. Breakfast was a little lacking in choices, but the eggs were good.
__label__negative	Not so bad for worst case scenario to stay here
__label__positive	"Hotel staff was very friendly. Location is perfect - close to everything. Two negatives - the hotel shuttle failed to show up. The front desk assured me this was an unusual occurrence and offered to pay my cab fare. This was a bad start to an otherwise great visit. The other negative - no coffee maker in the room. This is tough for a person who can't start up without caffeine. Coffee is served in the lobby at around 6:15AM for those who want to ""sleep in""."

__label__very_positive	Awesome time in Nola thanks to the Lamothe House
__label__positive	We found this property on Expedia and did not realize it is more like a gated community than a hotel. The resort is a little dated looking from the architecture but the rooms were nice and the beds were extremely comfortable. The only downside was that we reserved the smallest of rooms so there was not a mini fridge or microwave (we did not think we would need it at the time of booking). It was so late when we arrived that we did not have much time to look around but the restaurant at the clubhouse was open and had great live music. The food was also amazing! Not what we expected since most resorts are high price - low quality. There was so much food but since we did not have a mini fridge or microwave we could not take the leftovers. Since checkout was not until noon, it gave us plenty of time to explore the grounds and take a stroll on the nature walk. There are so many beautiful plants and the area is so peaceful. We will be sure to visit the resort again when we have more time so we can check out the pool and spa facilities.
__label__negative	When you spend around 130 you would expect better accommodations. It was extremely noisy and you could hear everything through the walls. And then to top it off be woken up by 5 Harley Davidson motorcycles at 7AM.
__label__positive	Stick with beer n shots. You know how much alcohol is in them.

__label__very_positive	Practical,clean, comfortable, reasonably priced and well located hotel. Especially well suited for family vacations
__label__positive	Even though it's right there across the street from the Fremont Experience with all that noise and energy, the room was quiet and nice.(Be aware! During special times like around New Year's, where bands are playing all the time, it might be loud....that was my experience at the D, the Grand, and another hotel. I cannot guarantee it won't be loud here too I just don't know.) Anyway, no complaints. at all.
__label__very_negative	they wouldn't except my service dog so I didn't stay. I got a cheaper price right on the beach. but other than that this hotel was a roach infested dump I wouldn't have stayed there even if they excepted my service animal.

__label__very_positive	We will be staying at one of the cabins this weekend, I haven't even gotten there yet and I already love the owners Ed and Janie. If the cabin is half as nice as they are I will be happy. DDrake
__label__negative	Not a clean room. sheets had stains and bathroom was smelly. Breakfast was terrible. But it was very cheap
__label__very_negative	Horrible hotel
__label__negative	We will never stay here again . The WiFi did not work , the signal strength was very weak . The remote did not work in our room . I went to front desk but she was no help . No ashtrays were in the smoking room . The bed was hard as a rock . Just a terrible stay .
__label__very_positive	The hotel is right in the heart of Old Town Alexandria on King Street. Shops, bakeries and wonderful restaurants lined the street. The 1 mile walk to the Metro gave us plenty of opportunities to window shop. The staff was great. Our room was a little on the small side, but for 2 nights we were more than satisfied. Highly recommended.
__label__positive	Nice size rooms. Reasonably priced. Courteous hotel staff. Overall, a pleasant experience so far. Recommended.
__label__very_positive	Even though the front of the hotel is on Rte 28, it is quiet and the views from the Adirondack chairs in back of the hotel are beautiful. Excellent stay.
__label__very_positive	Made a 40 min trip to visit Webster Manor for a special lunch. We arrived at 11:55 on a Monday and the large parking lot was filled already.

__label__very_positive	My room was relaxing, roomy, and very clean. I found the beds to be comfortable and appreciated the loon theme throughout. I enjoyed opening the windows and letting in the sunshine and fresh air. The owners were friendly and helpful, too. I would happily recommend this motel to my family and friends.

__label__very_positive	Great place to stay
__label__positive	Decent. A little pricey
__label__very_positive	We had a wonderful time here for our second trip. The resort was not as crowded due to renovations and the seaweed problem but still the staff was excellent. Food and drinks were very good. Room cleanliness was rated less than excellent because our room was not cleaned one day and the other days it wasn't cleaned until 5pm. Also the shower smelled and we never had a hot shower.
__label__positive	All good - hotel was very clean and well kept up
__label__very_positive	Enjoyed 4 nights in the Talia Suite (upgraded at check-in). Front desk staff are great. A special thanks to Jimmy who we were fortunate to have at check-in and check-out! U district location is vibrant, easy to get around, wide range of delicious and affordable dining options.
__label__very_positive	I will be back!!!
__label__very_negative	Disgusting
__label__neutral	Our stay was just OK. For the location, the buffet was a little over price compared to Las Vegas and was not as good. Had to wait for 15minutes to get to my room. The line was very long. Other than that, our stay was very pleasant.
__label__very_positive	One night only, but a nice one. New renno's high quality throughout. Comfy, modern accomodation. Our room overlooked grazing cattle and the relentless I-580, so it was busy, but totally silent. We'll be back.

__label__neutral	We stayed here for a quick overnight before heading home after visiting family. The suite room was great for staying with our son, with the separate sleeping area. The view of the Rockies was beautiful.
__label__very_positive	All shopping and restaurants are short walks from the hotel.  The best location of any hotel in Alexandria.  The staff was most accommodating.  One day, my wife and I decided to go for a walk along King Street.  A member of the hotel staff ran to us with an umbrella in hand.  He suggested we talk it in the event of rain.  We look forward to a return visit to the Hotel Monaco in the near future.

Loads of fantastic vegan options within walking distance. Hotel is really well kept, clean and quite. Staff are really helpful. We took a taxi to get there.
__label__positive	Family sad time equals a great hotel stay.
__label__positive	We were given a larger than expected room with a king bed. It was appointed well including an oversized stuffed chair with ottoman.

__label__positive	Blocks from the party but perfectly quiet to sleep
__label__very_negative	Not so great. My band mates and I drove 20 hours straight, walk into the hotel, and when I started the check in process he clerk said I don't want any problems. He also mentioned not wanting to have to call the police and basically implied that he didn't want us there. We were polite, and respectful the whole time. When it was time for the continental breakfast, there were no tables available, so we sat on the the couch that was 4 feet from the juice machine, and we were told to go find a table. The safe in the room was locked with the door open so we couldn't store our cash in there. We left for NYC, came back, and my buddy's bag was rummaged through. He always leaves his orange hunting knife on top of his clothes, but it was under his sweatshirt and a few other things when we got back. The screen onthe door to get on the patio was ripped from the bottom and up the side. The curtain was detached from the stick that you use to open and close them. I was not impressed with the stay. Not worth 120 a night.
__label__positive	The facility was very nice but it is a partial smoking hotel. When you walked in you can smell the smoke. My room though was a non-smoking room and it was comfortable and smoke-smell free.

__label__very_negative	Skip the restaurant here.  Mediocre at best. Get out and walk around for a good meal.
__label__very_negative	We arrived at 1030 pm to check in. The air conditioning in our room did not work and the staff could not move us to another room or fix the ac. The next day we found out that the swimming pool was not working. We had to switch hotels which took several hours to work out, causing us to miss out on work and errands we had planned to run that day.
__label__very_positive	This place is very convenient to Presque Isle Downs. The front desk staff was great and the room was very clean. I will be staying here often this summer for the races. I love that there is no nasty carpet! Also they have plenty of parking space if you are pulling a trailer.

I highly recommend this gorgeous hotel :-)

__label__neutral	This was our second stay at this hotel and I'm so glad that we found it. The hotel is clean as well as the rooms. We enjoyed the indoor pool which was warm and inviting as well as the hot tub. The morning breakfast was included with the stay, It wasn't the greatest but it filled my empty stomach, and the coffee was okay too. The other thing that I really liked about this hotel is that we were able to get an extended stay until 6:00pm for 25.00 which was fantastic since our flight was very late in the night, this allowed us to rest and shower, then go out to dinner before we went to the airport. I would keep coming back to this hotel if I was in this area without hesitation and I would suggest others to come here as well.
__label__neutral	The entrance is not clear so I walked through the garage to get to the front desk. Of course if your room overlooks the street you will handle the street noise. The nighttime receptionist won't get up from his seat, mumbles vague instructions, if he is the desk. The place is clean and everything works, so the 2 rating is fair. A free shuttle to SFO is the best perk.
__label__very_positive	WONDERFUL ......WE WILL BE BACK

__label__positive	The TV reception for main network channels didn't work.
__label__very_positive	Our stay was wonderful and exceeded our expectations. The personal touches were exquisite and unexpected, from greeting us by name as we got out of the car, to the personalized treats left on our bed at turn down. The food was delightful and there was always something delicious to nibble on in the living room. The room was expensive yet not overpriced. The bedding was luxurious. We have stayed at many 5 star hotels and this was by far the most welcoming and attentive. We stayed at the Ritz last year and it can't hold a candle to the service received at the Simpson Inn.

A little ways from the metro station, but there is a trolley that runs from 10-10 every 15 mins.  It was a lifesaver in the rain!  The staff was wonderful.  The kids loved the pool.  Lots of great restaurants and shopping nearby. Happy hour every evening.  Lots of dogs and very dog-friendly!
__label__positive	Me and my husband had a good time in this hotel, more secluded than other hotels, if you want privacy this is a good fit for you. Has a 4 diamond award winning reataurant on site - La Frida but with 30 extra charge per person but service is good and food is exceptional!

__label__negative	Lakeway Resort has great potential but manages to fall far below expectation for it's location and price point. The on property restaurant could be upgraded if they were to lease to McDonald's. The food was below mediocre. The wait staff seemed fine but the manager was to good at apologies. He was so prompt and proficient with, I'm so sorry, that it appeared staged. My guess is he gets a lot of practice. I believe this property is relying on it's location to carry the ball. I stayed twice in a month and they are consistently underwhelming. I' m done.
__label__very_positive	Very well cared for. Just had a small issue with trash in parking lot. Homeless also looking for handouts. Other than that we do choose to stay there when we go to Auburn.

The continental breakfast room was very small, and wasn't impressed with the whole impression on the motel.. We had to book to another motel, and had a hard time getting a refund back, because we had booked 2 nights there, and stayed 1. The manager however did give us the refund back. I would not recommend this place to anyone unless it was just an overnighter!!!

It was raining so we didn't get to use the pool but it seemed very nice. A little pricey but its a very nice hotel! Free wi-fi and free parking - additional pluses!

__label__very_positive	It was close to my Business meetings and Convention Center
__label__very_positive	Helpful courteous staff, recent remodel.
__label__very_positive	Our stay was wonderful. I cannot say enough things about how great the hotel staff were. Comfortable, well decorated rooms. Must love dogs--lots of dogs throughout the hotel and neighborhood
__label__negative	I was with my team traveling for a soccer tornument in west virginia. When I got to the motel it looked sketchy from first sight. The first night I stayed everything was fine, although my teamate a few rooms down said he had stains on his bed sheets. The next day I got new towels, and only one large towell... More
__label__negative	The main reason for our stay was a concert at the nearby xfinity center and the representation that the best Western had a free shuttle service 1 hour before the show we were told to wait at the front of the hotel for the shuttle it should be there in 20 minutes when it did not show we waited at the front desk while the clerk inquired where it was. By the time we were told that the shuttle was not going to get us there the concert had already started.we had to figure out how to get there pay to park and walk a half of mile to get there and we missed the first half hour it was a total disappointment.
__label__very_positive	This motel was very nice and not overly priced. The room was very clean and comfortable. There is no A/C and I imagine during mid summer this could make it very hot and maybe uncomfortable for some. The pool is in need of updating, but pools aren't really why we visited Lake Tahoe. Would definitely stay again.
__label__positive	great staff
__label__very_positive	Staff was very friendly and breakfast was nice to have before we left....
__label__very_positive	Needs update
__label__positive	met or exceeded all of our expectations, breakfast was included and was fantastic.
__label__neutral	Disappointing
__label__neutral	OK accommodations
__label__very_positive	Very nice place to rest while on the road
__label__very_positive	We chose Residence Inn by Marriott Irvine basically for its convenient location near the airport. Because of the convenient and complimentary hotel shuttle, it allowed us to make our visit to Orange County without having to rent a car. A local cab took us to our primary social event of that week-end. In addition to the convenience of the location, we were totally pleased to find our accommodations so exceptional as well as being able to enjoy the host of amenities that were offered by the hotel. And lastly, I cannot overlook the staff. They were exceptional people - and those include the breakfast area hosts who keep the area always stocked and continually tidy throughout the various time frames of breakfast. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would choose Residence Inn by Marriott Irvine again on our next visit.
__label__very_positive	We spent 4 days at hotel, very comfortable, convenient to areas we planned to visit.
__label__very_negative	Roof over your head
__label__positive	Grate for price
__label__negative	Amazing location but horrible service
__label__very_positive	Loved our Stay!
__label__neutral	Remodeling - And Then Some
__label__very_positive	Lovely clean, warm hotel, good advice and information for local attractions, and great value for money. Good variety breakfast. Ideal location close to restaurants.
__label__very_positive	Amazing Setup for the Price, worth every penny
__label__neutral	The bed had mold on it, there was also mold on the floor and side table. The Windows in the room and at the pool were so dirty you could barely see through them, the carpet had cigarette burns all over and had a moist feeling to it and the room smelled like old cigars, there was mild and mildew all over the bath tub. The employees were all very friendly.
__label__very_positive	Simply great stay
__label__positive	We spent one night there and would stay again. The king size bedroom was clean and room had a microwave and refrigerator which was very convenient. They have a continental breakfast with omelets, waffles, yogurt, cereal, fruit, etc. The clerk was very helpful the next morning when my prescription sunglasses needed to be fixed.
__label__positive	Beautiful hotel, great location. Loved the free wine in the lobby. Room was comfortable and roomy but the bathroom was too small. Trying to get ready in the morning required taking turns. No other mirror with an outlet anywhere else in the room. Jackson 20, restaurant on site, was fantastic. Room service was very slow in the morning.
__label__neutral	OK place for a night
__label__very_negative	Find another place!
__label__negative	Adequate, but no more than that.
__label__very_negative	Just so bad!
__label__very_positive	Yum, fresh cookies
__label__positive	couldn't plug in the coffee maker all good
__label__positive	We used to come up here for 1-2 nights every year for a staycation but I guess over 11 years things degrade and what used to feel like a retreat has now been closed in by more hotels, more crowds, more noise and less parking and less enjoyment. The front desk staff were rushed and did not explain things well and did not seem very accomodating. We'll try someone new next time we go to Park City.
__label__very_positive	Very comfortable
__label__positive	Check in was quick and easy, the lady at the desk was pleasant, and more than willing to help, as I needed things printed for my business. The hotel is clean and welcoming, although definitely not high end. I would definitely stay there again, because you can't beat the service especially for the price.
__label__positive	Beware of hidden fee
__label__positive	It was a 10 min+ walk to water bus, would have liked it closer. Located on the water on Lido island, away from the rush of Venice
__label__positive	Excellent, but.....
__label__very_positive	Company Meeting
__label__positive	Upon checking in Andrea at the front desk was very pleasant and helpful. The room was large and clean. Comfortable beds and couch. Breakfast was good, nice variety. The one thing I would say is the lady working the breakfast was cranky and glared a lot. Would definitely stay again.
__label__positive	Fantastisk strand som det tog 15 min att g till. Hotellet hade mycket bra mat. Rummen var nergngna och luktade lite mgel. Personalen var underbar. Wifi hade lg fart och kostade pengar.
__label__very_positive	My husband and I stayed over this Valentine's Day weekend with our 4 year old son and another family with a son the same age. From the moment we walked into the lobby with the most amazing scent, we knew it would be a great weekend. The staff are absolutely on par with what we expect at The Four Seasons.... More
__label__very_positive	I would stay again.
__label__very_positive	The Holiday Inn Express, just off of Capital Boulevard in Wake Forest, North Carolina is perhaps the best hotel in the area. This location exceeds the expectations you might have of a typical Holiday Inn Express chain hotel.
__label__neutral	great shopping & outdoor exercise options around. make sure you listen to the eco-option stuff at check in. good stuff, it may just confuse ya a bit if you blow them off!
__label__very_positive	This boutique hotel was fantastic! The staff was incredibly friendly and very helpful. We loved how pet friendly this hotel is, and how clean it is. We were in the heart of King Street and were very close to everything. I would highly recommend this hotel and I will be staying here again!
__label__positive	Not Bad...
__label__very_positive	From the moment my daughter and I walked in the front door of Lakeway Resort and were greeted by the friendly doorman and amazing atmosphere, we knew her wedding was going to be there. We met with Catering Sales Manager, Melanie Richardson, who spent as much time as we needed to show us around and answer questions. I was impressed with not only her helpful and happy demeanor, but with the great ideas she gave us due to her many years of wedding experience at Lakeway. During the wedding planning process of more than a year, we found Melanie to be very responsive to anything we needed and the great working relationship she had with our photographer and florist helped a great deal. Working with Melanie was truly like having a wedding planner as she coordinated everything with all of the many moving parts we had for a wedding of 225 people and did it very efficiently and calmly. Needless to say, the ceremony and reception were spectacular! The room set up for the ceremony felt like you were in a church with an amazing view and the reception was so incredible it should have been in a magazine. The wait staff and service were great and the food was fantastic!!!! Another great part of having the wedding there was that everyone could be together for the entire weekend and the amenities Lakeway has with a great pool and swim-up bar, golf, workout room, etc. really was a vacation for guests. Everyone had a great time and it will be a wedding that none of us forget thanks to everyone at Lakeway!
__label__neutral	unknown cost, Utility Fee $10. plus tax/day
__label__positive	The facility is handy, clean , and relaxing and the staff is great. The breakfast menu is terrific. The only suggestion I have is for a bigger tv. We've stayed there before and have been pleased. /it is a perfect location for everything in the Hyannis, Dennis and Yarmouth area.
__label__very_positive	Awesome
__label__negative	I was not happy with the room not private, the sink was out no privacy, the room was not very clean ... The breakfast was a bad joke ... The place need to be better cleaned
__label__very_positive	This was the best hotel stay ever in TX the staff was very friendly and the room was fantastic. I'm planning to stay here again in April
__label__positive	The staff was very friendly and were more than happy to help us with any requests we had. It was close to the Miller Ferry and not too far from Sandusky where we were meeting extended family for a surprise birthday dinner. Bathroom was clean, no bugs or hairs found. Simple but good breakfast. Would stay here again.
__label__positive	We booked this hotel about a week ahead of time and were pleased. The hotel was recently updated. The bathrooms were beautiful. Our beds were comfy and clean. The pool and hot tub was a nice touch compared to the chilly weather outside. The only downfall was that someone put our bill under the door in the morning and it was substantially lower than what I had paid through expedia. When I inquired, I was told that it was a mistake and that I should not have gotten a bill. Breakfast was tasty but kind of pricy in the restaurant, the hotel did give us a credit but only for the registered adults. Not a free continental as advertised.
__label__positive	Clean and Comfortable
__label__very_positive	I don't want to leave a lengthy review - suffice it to stay, if you're on the fence, book a room. It is very elegant, the staff is extremely hospitable, and the location is top notch. My only complaint is that they charge $20/Day for parking, but that's easily fixed by parking around the corner (plenty of spots at night!)
__label__very_positive	Went to Longwood Gardens.
__label__positive	We just returned from staying at this Marriott and I have to report mixed reviews. The night manager, Jorge, was great--very personable, helpful, friendly. The new breakfast selections were outstanding. Those are the good points and that's why I gave it a Very Good rating. The bad part was that the carpet in our room was so stained in many... More
__label__very_negative	hotel appeared rundown and old, fixtures were outdated and did not work. breakfast was lame, towels were old and thin. Very disappointed.
__label__positive	wonderful stay
__label__negative	Hotel 2* maximum
__label__positive	Hotel und Service waren Super! Die Dusche war der Hammer! Frhstcks Bffet war auch sehr reichhaltig und gut! Knnen wir nur Empfehlen!
__label__positive	Nice but hard to get people to clean the room
__label__positive	convenient to our business travels and accomodating, staff went out of their way to give directions around hwy construction
__label__neutral	Room housekeeping needs to improve. Dirty pillowcase, blankets, and decorations
__label__neutral	The front desk was extremely friendly, helpful and courtliest -- HIGH marks. They attempted to resolve some issues we had with the room. We were travelling with 4 people including a limited mobility young adult. We booked a suite for additional room, but the shape of the room was difficult to maneuver. The front desk made some furniture changes for us which was helpful. However, the hotel which stated free parking had limited parking on site (overflow was across a highway in an open lot) and only two designated handicapped parking spaces which were mostly occupied. This made travel difficult.
__label__very_negative	Horrible just horrible
__label__very_positive	2nd time here, no regrets
__label__negative	We checked in expecting a pool for our 7 year old son to use while sister was orienting at UCR. The pump was broken, and pool was closed. We were not apprised of this by management at check-in, and discovered it the following morning. We were forced to cancel the rest of out stay and move hotels. When checking out... the desk clerk (Eddie - dead eyes, no politeness or courtesy) indicated that the General Manager (Vanessa - named but never seen) was aware of the situation. There was no apology, no polite attention to our dilemma, no offer for a discount for our inconvenience or an offer to make it right during our possible next stay. How does Holiday Inn plan to convince us to return Our daughter will be attending UCR for the next 4 years, and we will be needing a place to stay each time we visit. Hundreds of dollars I will be spending ANYWHERE but Holliday Inn, if that is the kind of treatment guests should expect from the lame management team in Colton. So sad....
__label__positive	Relax
__label__positive	Great stay
__label__very_positive	Just like the other reviews: parking isn't convenient, sliding bslcony door almost impossible to open and close from the outside, and cleaning was spotty. One day the housekeeping didn't arrive until 5:00 p.m., which is hard to plan around as far as showering and getting ready for dinner out. Breakfast was plentiful, with many options. The hot food choices were delicious. Reserved a suite and the extra space came in handy. The location is great, but the festival 3 blocks down could be heard until midnight or later. Thankfully the suite bedroom is on the parking side so the sound did not penetrate the bedroom.
__label__positive	room was comfortable and made it restful.
__label__very_negative	Find somewhere else
__label__very_positive	Renovated new. Nice bed. Clean. Friendly staff Close to the highway. Breakfast was nice and kids had a lot of good choices. Bathroom very clean and newly renovated
__label__very_negative	We needed an inexpensive place to stay for the family but it turned out to be a mistake! Carpet has not been vacuumed in a long time, very dirty with pieces of trash all over. The bathroom was gross! Hair on the floor and in the tub... The final straw is when we grabbed our bag to leave and a roach came crawling out from under it!! The hotel manager was apologetic at least and refunded half of my cost. Hotel looks nice from the outside but don't let that fool you. Who validates the housekeeping crew Seems like nobody. I will never stay here again...
__label__very_positive	Modernes Hotel mit super Service, gute Lage!
__label__negative	This motel really doesn't feel safe. The lobby is closed at night with only a small bank teller window to interact with the front desk staff. The parking lot had lots of trash from fast food restaurants next door. My room's metal door was kicked and dented so badly that it had a huge gap at the bottom through which daylight, and noise passed. The bed was rock hard. The carpet was dirty. The room smelled of stale smoke even though it was supposedly a non-smoking room. The shower head was underwhelming and too low for a man of average height. The elevator interior is just plywood and creaked as the elevator ascended. This motel offers no amenities other than a single bar of soap and a single bottle of shampoo. The motel is in the process of replacing room carpets. There was debris piled everywhere. Construction noise started at 7:30 a.m. each day.
__label__very_positive	Our stay was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful and staff very friendly and helpful. The price compared to other hotels in the area was outstanding! Would definitely stay here again. Loved out stay! Asked for a late check out and was given an hour at no charge. Room clean, pool and fitness were nice. Did not eat at the hotel... More

__label__positive	The staff was very friendly. The room was clean and very affordable for my purposes. The breakfast was excellent.
__label__positive	They where still renovating to the new hotel. It will be nice once it is done. Beds were not really comfortable. We asked for towels for the pool and they gave us bath mats.
__label__very_positive	Perfect Stay in Phoenix
__label__negative	So-So
__label__very_positive	Had a great stay here everything was wonderful room very spacious! We stayed 3 days and was very satisfied. Loved how the layout of the room was beds very comfy,flat screen tvs! Loved we actually had glasses in the room instead of plastic cups. Had everything we needed.
__label__very_positive	We really enjoyed it
__label__negative	We stayed for 3 nights in one of the regular double bed rooms. It was dark and poorly lit, and the walls were paper thin. The neighbors were noisy, and if someone jumped upstairs, the whole place shook. The bathroom was dark and had no ventilation, and when you turned on the sink, it made a loud noise. It was not the worst place we could have stayed, but it certainly wasn't glamorous.
__label__very_positive	The staff was great.
__label__negative	No Bikes Allowed
__label__very_positive	The little extras really make this a nice place to stay. Free beer, 5-6 TV's to watch football, the food is so-so. The Internet speed is lacking, so if your looking for speed go somewhere else.
__label__negative	The very last option..
__label__very_positive	Very nice hotel with great amenities. Microwave, in room coffeemaker, ironing board and iron, great buffet breakfast with 24 hour coffee available in the lobby. Close to the T and the Science Museum and duck boats. Supermarket was within walking distance, great pizza and sandwich shop right around the corner. We were in Boston for a family wedding. The hotel... More
__label__neutral	Hotel was clean and quiet. Breakfast was terrible. We arrived 30 minutes after it was to begin. There was no milk for the cereal and they offered all starches- French toast sticks, waffles, bagels, English muffins, dry cereal. No fruit no yogurt.
__label__very_positive	Definitely coming back
__label__positive	Great room.
__label__very_positive	Very clean and comfortable. Very pleasant staff. Great location for restaurants and shopping. Complimentary breakfast was fine, except my husband enjoys bacon or sausage with his eggs in the morning - that was the only thing missing.
__label__positive	Nothing country about it.
__label__very_positive	This was a typical Holiday Inn Express which we always find to be nice and have comfortable rooms. The staff was very friendly, rooms were nice and clean and the hotel is located close (not walking distance) to historic town square. We would pick this hotel if we were visiting the area again.
__label__positive	I went down to New Orleans to celebrate my Birthday weekend which happened to be Memorial Day weekend so all of the reasonable priced rooms in New Orleans were booked. I know I would be traveling between New Orleans, Abita Springs, and Slidell all weekend long so booking this reasonably priced hotel by the bride that you cross before you get to Chalmette (and it's right by the interstate) was AWESOME. Check-in was a breeze (clerk was nice and knowledgeable), room was cleaner and more comfortable than I expected and water in the shower gets mega hot...WIN, WIN! The only one complaint I have is that there are only 3 hot items (besides coffee) on the breakfast menu (sausage, eggs, and you can make a waffle). All I ask is that they get another waffle making machine because when there is a crowd making a waffle or two a piece, it become a tedious, tiring process. Overall, I would stay again because even the other guest who were staying there was courteous of the other guest. Thank you for a wonderful stay!
__label__very_positive	Great stay at Best Western
__label__very_positive	wonderful experience
__label__very_positive	This hotel is very nice, well kept, very clean. The rooms are very comfortable, wifi is good. The area has a lot of restaurants and shops around for taking a walk around the area.If you're in the area, this is a great place to stay.
__label__very_positive	Good hotel, nice style, perfect location, OK price
__label__very_positive	Our 4 night stay was not for pleasure. My Dad had passed away last month and all of the out of town relatives had come to Princeton for his Memorial Service over the Fathers Day weekend. Most of us stayed at this AmericInn. Several other relatives tried, but being Fathers Day weekend, they booked up fast. The other relatives said... More
__label__very_positive	Convenient location
__label__neutral	Price & locatioh is good but cleansiness
__label__positive	Room was clean, breakfast was okay. Needed wheat bread options, or they just don't refill often enough. Also some quests were making a complete mess at breakfast counter so the counter was not cleaned often enough.
__label__positive	Lake Charles Casino Trip
__label__positive	Friendly staff. good parking. Room was clean. Slight odor with the air on, disappeared after a while. I wouldn't say that this hotel was remodeled, more like refreshed. New paint, new tv, upgrades in lobby and dining area. Great location. Close to many dining options. Starbucks is 2 blocks away. Close to Walmart, other shopping options. Good value.
__label__positive	Very nice hotel and area
__label__positive	My wife and I booked a Friday night away in one of the whirlpool rooms. Found the hotel to be everything we wanted and more. Huge room for a good price, friendly and attentive staff, hot breakfast with good options and convenient 12:00 check out. One small issue was the jets in the jetted tub were weak and didn't offer... More
__label__very_positive	Our 2nd time at this hotel in the heart of historic Alexandria. Staff is welcoming and knowledgable and check-in was a breeze. The 5-6 pm happy hour in the lobby is clearly a big draw as it was packed with enthusiastic wine drinkers, several with their dogs who are welcomed at the hotel.Valet parking is available or you can self park in the underground garage which we did. However the validated ticket didn't work and we had to pay to get out. There is a $29 per day parking charge but the staff were quick to override the charge given our difficulty.Highly recommend this hotel.
__label__neutral	Good to stop and rest after a long day of driving. The place could use a remodel, it seemed a bit outdated. The room was clean. The bed was comfortable enough. I would stay there again, if I was on the road and just passing through.
__label__negative	Jackhammering Cement on Saturday Morning.
__label__very_positive	Wonderful breakfast, nice decor! I had the grilled salmon, moist and flaky. My husband had an omelet, cooked to perfection. Super friendly staff. Coffee was delicious. Everything was clean. Quiet, can't wait to go for dinner!
__label__positive	This obviously is a hotel that has seen better days. The staff was great, however, the room was a huge disappointment. It is in desperate need of remodeling. The beds were horrible! Everything was just old!
__label__very_negative	Worst hotel I've ever visited
__label__positive	The computers were down, and the manager couldn't find out reservation. She seemed a little put out that we booked through Expedia and not through Choice Hotels. The room smelled heavily like cleaning or carpet fluidfluid. The breakfast was ok.
__label__very_positive	Excellent value
__label__neutral	Helpful, nice Inkeepers rooms fair.

__label__positive	Stay at Holiday Inn Express & Suites W.Monroe,La
__label__positive	great location, just outside the busiest areas.  beautiful beach and amenities.  could use some updating to get it out of the 1980's, but it's clean, and the staff are friendly.
__label__very_positive	We originally planned on staying for 2 nights and changed it to 3 nights at the last minute. We had a wonderful stay. The staff was very helpful and professional. The continental breakfast was one of the best I've had. The only issue I have was we had to pay for parking. I wish that was included in the stay but it is what it is. I'd definitely stay here again if I'm up around the Hartford area.
__label__positive	Nice hotel, nice rooms, nice staff, nice pool Only problem was the people above us stomping around and running and jumping off beds (more than likely uncontrolled children). Pool was nice and clean but there were uncontrolled children that made the enclosed, heated pool intolerable.
__label__positive	We travelled to Shreveport to judge in a BBQ contest being held at Sam's Club. Check-in was quick and we received the type of room requested.

__label__very_positive	Didn't stay here but held a wonderful reception here. The food was absolutely the best and the staff was very friendly and helpful. This place reminds me a lot of La Fonda in Santa Fe. Wonderful location in San Jose in the center of shopping and dining at Santana Row.
__label__neutral	I like the hotel, facilites, perks (free dinner M-Th), etc. This is by far my favourite place to stay in CR. My only criticism is of the front desk staff - they seem uninterested in service.
__label__positive	Very clean, staff was friendly and helpful.
__label__neutral	Surprisingly Good
__label__very_positive	Stayed overnight here. Room was dirty, sheets stained, holes in them, etc.... Bathroom condition was tolerable. If I had paid one third this much I would have expected it.

__label__neutral	the hotel staff were helpful, the hostess in the restaurant on Sat am 5/28 was less then cordial. The balcony is nothing like your website, the view was nothing to srite home about, and the floor of the balcony had black indoor-outdoor carpet that was filthy, lifted off the whole balcony that an elderly person would've fallen. The fridge plug was in-op warm fridge and the door to the balcony did not lock :(

__label__positive	We had a one night stay. The staff was cordial, breakfast good. I was a little disappointed that the neighborhood of the hotel was not nearly as nice as the picture on the website made it look. Definitely a little pricey but they did let us leave our car their all day and close to public transportation. Overall pretty good.

__label__negative	Don't stay here if you want to use the internet
__label__very_positive	Our stay was short. Basically we just spent the night there. The room was clean, the sheets were clean and the lobby was bright open and inviting. They have a small pool and hot tub which we didn't use and a decent free breakfast in the morning. All in all, this is a fine place to stay if you are just looking for something no frills.

__label__very_negative	First room checked into the room smelled of dog and urine so bad that my throat stared to close off and I couldn't breath. I went down to the front desk and they were giving some difficulty because I made the reservation on. We hen I told them I had allergies and can't stay in that room is when they gave me another room. That rooms beds are like sleeping in conceret and the sheet have holes in them so you can see the matteress. The towels have holes in them and are so rough they feel like sandpaper. I booked this hotel because I had a pool and said limited pets. Well the pool is broken too. If it wasn't for the fact that I'm here because a family had an accident and is in the hospital I would not stay here. Since it's also a holiday weekend rooms are limited. I can say NEVER AGAIN WILL I STAY HERE!

__label__negative	Literally had to make our bed upon check in. I booked through Expedia and my room was paid for and guaranteed for late arrival.....but that hotel didn't care! I arrived at 11:00 pm and the clerk informed me that I got the last room and he had to clean it real fast, and the blankets just got done drying, so he would send them up with me. I was upset and let him know. He did apologize and said since I booked through Expedia, he could not discount or comp me. The bathroom was gross, and the door didn't open all the way because the tub stopped it. The floor felt as if you were gonna fall thru. Dry blood was splattered on the ceiling and blow dryer. It was gross. And they do not vacuum because the same crud was there for two days.

__label__very_positive	This past Friday was my wedding, which took place at The Abbey Resort, and I can't say enough good things about this place! Our wedding took place in the gazebo by the West Shore Pavilion, and the reception was in the pavilion. It was beautiful, quiet, and quaint, just as we'd hoped, and we loved that we were able to go right from our ceremony to cocktail hour to our reception without taking transportation. Our guests thoroughly enjoyed themselves, and they all thought the resort was one of the nicest places they've stayed, from the rooms to the amenities. I want to give a special thanks for Robyn Moe, our wedding coordinator, who was amazing throughout the whole process of planning our wedding. She answered all of our e-mails and phone calls very promptly, and she made sure that our day was just as we'd imagined it. I can't thank her enough for bearing with us, especially towards the end when I was getting overwhelmed and had to change some things in a matter of days. She even picked me up in a golf cart to drive me from my room to the reception tent right before the ceremony when my husband asked her if she could. Also, Justin Juntunen, who helped us book our room and block of room for our guests, was awesome and was always there to answer e-mails promptly and take care of any situations we needed help with. I also want to thank Tauna, from the Avani Spa in The Abbey resort. She did my hair trial and my hair on they day of the wedding, and she was absolutely incredible at making my hair look just like the picture from Pinterest that I showed her. She was also very friendly, kind, and she made me feel very at ease on the day of the wedding. She is truly talented at what she does, and I wouldn't want anyone else to do my hair on the day of my wedding :). When we decided to book our wedding at The Abbey, we were given a list of their preferred vendors, and that made it super easy to find quality vendors! We loved everything about this place. :)

__label__very_negative	When I booked I put I needed a crib. There were only two in the whole hotel. The one I got was broken. I had to share a bed with my 16 month old for 2 nights. Also the pool was empty with no water. After playing a very hot softball tournament, my children and all their friends also staying were disappointed not to be able to swim. Last, we left some headphones, which I know was our fault, but we have called twice now and no one can give me any information.

__label__positive	Man erreicht das Hotel nur bequem mit dem Auto. Es liegt in einer ruhigen Seitenstrae, die man ber den Stadtring ( circovalazione) erreicht. Das Hotel ist sehr gepflegt und hat eine angenehme ruhige Atmosphre. Das Abendessen ist in der Auswahl klein, aber sehr frisch und von sehr guter Qualitt bei kleinem Preis. Einen kleinen Abstrich muss man bei der Sicherheit geben, denn die Zimmer besitzen keine Sicherheitsschlsser und das Badfenster schloss nicht richtig, lediglich die Jalousie. Das Zimmer hatte jedoch einen Safe. Auerdem kommen regelmig Carabinieri, so dass man sich dennoch nicht unsicher fhlte.

__label__positive	Amazing location, stylish hotel
__label__positive	We enjoyed our stay and found the Plaza hotel very accommodating. We had a problem with the plumbing that was fixed promptly. Our out unsolved issue is that the TV cable system was very slow, it took about 6 to 7 seconds to move from channel to channel.
__label__positive	This was our first visit to the resort and the hotel was ideally placed just in the Centre and very close to the sea and also the restaurants and bars, all of which were really good, although maybe a little more expensive that usual. The hotel was very clean and the food (although we only had breakfast there) was always fresh and hot and plenty of it. We requested a high room with sea view if possible and that is exactly what we got, it was brilliant to wake up and see the sunrise each morning. The balcony would have been perfect if it had enough room for loungers, but was still okay. Our only complaint, and it is a big one, is that the hotel is advertised as having 2 pools and a children's pool and it didn't! The pool area downstairs was always in the shade and therefore the seating area was not very welcoming and the pool too cold to swim in. We thought there was another pool on the rooftop sun terrace and were particularly looking forward to that. But although there were plenty of sun loungers and a lovely Jacuzzi, there was no pool and it did spoil our visit a little as I in particular was looking forward to a daily swim. This really needs addressing if they are going to advertise it as such. Other than that, we had a brilliant holiday and would recommend the hotel - if you aren't bothered about the pool that is!!

__label__very_positive	The hotel is well maintained, with many amenities. The staff throughout are friendly and helpful. The Wi-Fi signal was very strong and had decent speeds throughout the property. The indoor pool is very large and the hotel has an indoor hot tub as well as a male and female sauna/showers in the indoor area. The outdoor pool has a tiki bar with food and there is a sanded volleyball area adjacent to the outdoor pool. The breakfast is great for those seeking everything short of eggs (though they do offer hard-boiled eggs). The waffles are the star of breakfast (3 machines - get there before 9 to beat the rush). I definitely would stay hear again. Very family friendly too!

__label__very_negative	The mini-fridge was on the floor jutting out under the sink, making it impossible to stand comfortably at the sink. When I investigated why the lamp on the bedside table didn't work, I found it wasn't plugged in and there was no outlet within reach. Although I had a non-smoking room, guests repeatedly sat on the steps below my room playing music and smoking, and their cigarette smoke wafted into my room through the large visible air gap around the door frame. Will never stay here again.

__label__negative	I was thankful that my sister arrived at the hotel first so I did not have to go through the hassle of trying to figure out where the front desk was located. We arrived late and the front desk area was not marked either on the outside of the hotel or on the inside. Yes, they are under construction but even hand written paper signs on doors or down hallways can be made to help clear up the confusion! The door to the front desk is under the scaffolding on the corner. It is not the obvious entrance. Mid-way down the building there is a large entrance easily seen but there are no signs of any sort giving any directions. A large sign inside announces that in mid-2015 the construction will be complete. When that happens the hotel will certainly be a great place to stay. However for now, it is a bit confusing until you wander around a bit.

__label__positive	Me and my family stayed here for 4 nights and for the most part this hotel was very nice. Many of the reviews i read suggested to get a room on the third floor away from the main street due to noise and foot traffic. We asked the front desk staff (Bob) for a room on the third floor and he found us one! The room was clean and bigger than most hotel rooms, bathroom was clean and functional, and the beds were comfortable. Only complaint would be that the pillows are too small. Soft but small. The breakfast was enough with the essentials (toast, coffee, fruit, cereal, waffles, etc). There was one day that we came back to our hotel around 5 and our room hadn't been cleaned yet. Housekeeping opened our door while we were there and we asked her to come back in half an hour but she said she had to go so we told her that we would leave while she cleans. We left the room asap and we saw her at the elevator and she said she couldn't clean our room anymore because she had to leave. We stopped at the lobby and spoke to front desk, the same maid stopped by also saying that we told her that we were do not disturb. Fortunately another kind maid said that she would clean our room. Also, heed the warnings about the walls being suuuuuuuuper thin. I swear I heard a couple next door doing stuff at 6am one morning. Parking was free which was excellent. The underground parking was never full and we always found parking.

__label__negative	I was disappointed at the amount of time I had to wait to get checked in. There was only one clerk at the front desk. She was very nice, but there where a lot of people checking in and no one to assist her. I'm also very annoyed at the fact that, even though I payed in full for my room online, I was required to put an additional 100.00 room deposit, in case I decided to trash the room, I guess. They said it would be refunded to my card after my stay, but that it would probably take a week to go through. Over all wasn't happy.

__label__negative	VERY DISAPPOINTED IN STAFF. If you need to book a block of rooms....don't go here! Their staff does not know how to look on a computer to see if the rooms are actually available or not in that block. Had to scramble to get wedding guests hotel rooms else where because the staff at Doubletree told them that our block was full. Week before the wedding, I got a call from hotel saying I still had rooms available and if we were going to fill them or not. Very disappointed in their service.

Around 9:00 I decided to get the kids ready for bed and, based in the condition and cleanliness of the hotel, I decided to look under the sheets on the beds. Between the mattress pad and the fitted sheet, there were bed bugs crawling around...I didn't lift the mattress pad at that point. I called the front desk and told them there was a big problem in our room and when I mentioned the bed bugs, the front desk attendant did not seem surprised and said she would send the manager up to our room. The manager, too, did not seem surprised and said we could change rooms or get a refund. We left the hotel at 9:15 and went to another hotel in Iowa City.

__label__very_positive	This hotel was the best hotel that I ever stayed so far, and might be also in my entire life. Especially, the service was speechless. I got in some trouble but the receptionist helped me a lot even it was out of her concerns. It was really stunning service and I was so impressed. Overall, the location is so nice that you can go everywhere so quickly from this hotel, breakfast was amazing, bedding was so nice and clean. I would stay this hotel for sure whenever I have any chance to go Florence again.

__label__very_positive	This hotel was very nice, it was clean and the staff was great, we weren't in the room long when the phone rang and it was the front desk to see if everything was satisfactory. The breakfast was also very good. I would recommend this hotel to everyone we were all very pleased.

The only complaint I have is that the air conditioner was off when we went to the room, and it took hours to cool down in that South Georgia heat!

__label__neutral	The check in procedure was a little inconvenient bc u have to go inside the gas station next to it, and the rooms are inside so no individual outside access, so that part doesn't make sense. The price wasn't too bad, but you must remember that you get what u pay for. It's not fancy but there is a sports bar next door that has amazing pizza. Also there is a gas station and very easy access to the interstate. There was a microwave and mini fridge in the room we were in which is always ni...view morece. The ice machine was broken so we had to walk to the gas station to fill our ice bucket which was a little inconvenient and the phone in our room was broken which isn't a big deal bc we have cell phones.

__label__very_positive	Baymont Inn was a very clean place, the service there was outstanding, the ladies I dealt with were very pleasant to talk and helpful. The room was clean with plenty of room to just relax or take care of work stuff online. It is a place I would say at again when I am in town. It was a little bit of a drive from where I was visiting, but it was one of the nicer hotels and it was close to place such as the mall and restaurants.

__label__negative	This is an old badly maintained hotel, charging as 4 stars, deserves 1 or 2 stars. Room is small, old, dirtty, walls are dirty needs painting, dust everywhere, awful. Elevator is old and slow. In the morning guests choose the stairs. Breakfast is plain, nothing special. Neighbourhood is bad, next to train station. There are lots of better hotels in Firenze, not listed in Expedia.
__label__negative	We booked this on a last minute visit to the area, we were looking for a good value. The reviews were half way decent, but when we arrived, were disappointed in the rooms. The bathroom had a mold ring around the toilet and significant mildew on the walls and floor. The bed seemed dirty as well, but I could have been more aware after seeing the bathroom. The hotel was full and it was late at night so we did not make arrangements for another room. I would not stay there again.
__label__very_positive	Great food ,Mountain views, beautiful room. Stuff was very attentive,would totally stay again! We had a fireplace in our room which was awesome when it start to snow on our third night in Colorado Springs.
__label__very_positive	Nice hotel for my price
__label__neutral	staff was friendly. room has a slight odor possibly from being closed in, tub was clean but stained, shower head was old/nasty looking semi clogged, sink looked as though it needed to be reset sealed, toilet would run for about 15mins after every flush, breakfast was what I expected but they did not put out more(bread, muffins, fruit) when they got low. pool was nice but the safety rings were old dirty falling apart. Overall because of the location, friendly staff good price seeing the time of year. I would stay there again but I would like a different room.
__label__positive	Hotel is nice and clean. This year they had free wifi in rooms too. This is a big change because It was a big discomfort in the yesteryears. They should better up their breakfast. Seems like the fresh fruits have disappeared. Rooms are expensive every year. Services have not improved a single bit. I have been staying here for last five years. Next year if their price goes up then I'd rather go to a five star at this price or a little higher. There are better options at higher price.

__label__neutral	The hotel itself was quiet, and the location was easy to find but could use some updates.  I went to use the gym and two out of the three treadmills were broken.

__label__positive	Located at an highway exit that has not yet fully developed has advantages and disadvantages. The area around the hotel feels more like a quiet office park on the weekends. While there are no restaurants within walking distance, there is a Starbucks on-site and the evening bar has full menu. THis is a nice, clean, quiet place to stay in the North Worth Worth - DFW- Grapevine area. No night life nearby. But if you want to relax after a long flight or drive, this is a good option.

__label__very_negative	Hotel was definitely not worth the money...they charge an extra person fee (yes I know it's listed on the website) but I think it's ridiculous to charge 15/person extra per day (20 with taxes!) when there are no services the extra person is even utilizing....no continental breakfast, no extra bed provided so what's the point not to mention the woman who checked us in suggested moving us to a different room on the first floor with a cot (after lugging heavy suitcases up three flights of stairs due to lack of elevator) and we never agreed to it...but then she charged us the extra person fee as well as the room upgrade to have a twin and a queen..well if we had a room with a queen and a twin (which we didn't) why would we pay for the extra person fee as two people can fit in a queen and one in a twin...hotel just didn't have much to offer. when i told the receptionist i didn't want to be moved to a noisy room she goes yeah there's a bar behind us all of our rooms are really noisy and the shower head was literally so low on the wall. I'm 5'2 and I struggled using it...i honestly don't know how someone any taller than i am would have been able to utilize the room. staff was very unfriendly and the rooms needed major updating...so not worth the high price they charge.

__label__neutral	We decided to book this hotel for a weekend stay-cation. We are from the Dayton area and knew the miller lane area had plenty of restaurants for our getaway. We have stayed in the south location by the Dayton mall and always enjoy our service, and the room... However, this location seems less organized and not as up kept. The employees parked wherever they wanted, maintenance trucks taking up half the parking lot (not even in spaces) and making it difficult since it was a one way driveway. Also, the bed was VERY hard and uncomfortable, I almost preferred the sofa pull out mattress. Our mirror was cracked, which wouldn't have been a big deal if we didn't have a toddler trying to touch it... And the tub was clogging when we showered. Also, the stove kept randomly turning on.. Yes seriously.. Just clicked on. Our sink faucet had a steady drip as well as the bathroom cold knob did not turn (but the hot water also never got hot).

__label__neutral	The Gardena Terrace Inn was just a one night stay for us. At first glance the front desk is nice and remodeled and the person working was super nice. Going to the room, the elevator certificate was out of date and so was the ambiance. There is courtyard area in the middle of the hotel to sit which was nice. Inside the room it was large and all counter tops/tables remodeled with the same quartz as the front desk but inside the room was brown. The bathroom was also remodeled with body wash, shampoo, and conditioner dispensers on the inside of the wall but for our room, the body wash was completely drained and there were no bars of soap. There was one, clearly used bottle of body lotion by the sink but I feel soap is more important than lotion. We got in late and left early. This inn got the job done and that's about it. Kudos to the workers for being so kind and I'm sure the amenities would have been refilled if we had asked.

Only had housekeeping 1 day that was only because I requested it. He offered me a small broom and broken dustpan to clean my own room up. Then after checkout took off 55 off of my card. (Tried to take 250)... After not listening to me to explain myself he started cussing and spewing profanities. He said the room had damage. Which was some chocolate from my daughter. And some vacuum wouldn't handle. Well Housekeepers... I had the police involved, he agreed with me on all. He couldn't return my money but gave me a lesson....lol. that's to NEVER give them my business and hope I can prevent somebody else from loosing some money.

__label__neutral	The condo resort is in a great location, and has nice facilities and very secure. But, when arriving, our condo's floor was very filthy, and did not look like it had been cleaned in quite a while. We asked to have a mop and bucket so that we could clean it, and it took them 3 hours to find one. (kind of stands to reason why the floor was so dirty). We are not picky, and not 'clean freaks', but when your feet pick up not only dirt, but dust bunnies....just saying! The frustrating thing about it, was that the office staff did not apologize to us. We get that things get overlooked, but you do need to acknowledge the situation and try to make it right. No one did.

__label__very_positive	My daughter and I were touring the Wash. DC area and we appreciated the charming and historical setting of Alexandria. It was nice to be staying outside of the city but with the conviences of being close to the Metro and Reagan as well as the hotel shuttle service. The Monaco is clean, has elegant but fun decor and the support staff very efficent. The only minor complaint would be our room being located across from the elevators which made for constant pinging and people traffic noise.
__label__neutral	Just Ok
__label__neutral	Very good budget hotel
__label__neutral	We stayed last weekend and will start by saying the hotel is definitely older and needs updating! I understand it's high season right now, but it's always high season with Disneyland up the street, so eventually Marriott will need to suck it up and get it done! Most in need is the plumbing, which is remarkably substandard. Our tub had... More
__label__very_negative	Don't know why Expedia would recommend this run down hotel, roach infested, bed broken falling down one side, shower stays running lights not working in bathroom.  Zero stars.Luckily they gave me my money back cause I chose not to stay there within 5 minutes of check-in after horrible conditions of rooms.
__label__very_positive	Consistantly Clean and Good Value
__label__very_negative	Food was costly here as expected from Hyatt hotel. If you are on leisure trip , you can take cheaper options like boutique hotels like shambaling in boudha, though shambaling's access road is not good but service is good. Great property, big enough to spend time inside it. Its near boudh stupa which is walkable from here. Good food options near boudh stupa
__label__neutral	The lobby was hot, the beds were extremely uncomfortable, the bathroom in the room was not clean. The breakfast was mediocre (that is probably a generous description). The pool and hot tub we're large, perfect temperature and enjoyable.
__label__very_positive	We stayed here for a couple of nights and were stunned at how good it is. It's location is superb (10 mins walk to the Eiffel Tower, 2 mins to Passy metro station or 5 mins to the Eiffel Tower stop which is a little better connected and minutes from several excellent restaurants, cafes, bars etc just up the hill past the Passy metro). The room was excellent with a sleek looking and different appearance and came with all expected amenities plus more! Huge bath and very comfy bed were plus points as well as an espresso machine and nice touches such as chocolates etc. The mini spa in the basement was really good and open 24 hours (just call the reception to switch it on) and a really nice place to relax with a large Jacuzzi and steam room. Staff were superb and dealt with everything we needed from a welcome glass of champagne to arranging some champagne and rose petals in our room as a surprise - they literally did everything we asked of them and provided some very good suggestions of places to eat and short cuts to places etc. I couldn't fault this hotel one bit and for a romantic weekend in Paris (the hotel is very much set up for couples) then don't look anywhere else. Seriously one of the best hotel's I've stayed at anywhere in the world, would highly recommend.
__label__negative	The room was very small, the cable was fuzzy and not HD, and all the doors stuck or were not properly fitted for the opening. This was a $90 room, not at $150 room. Way over priced for location and condition. Not what I would expect from Best Western.

__label__very_negative	Besides the foul/unusual smell in the hotel room and the unusually cold pool, this stay was great. We selected this hotel because we were traveling with a group of my daughter's friends and we knew the kids would be happy to have a pool to swim in. Well, so much for that, the kids could not even swim in the big pool because it was so cold. They moved to the hot tub and after a few minutes we had a bunch of blue lipped 4 year olds. The funky,sour, old vacuum cleaner bag smell in the room was enough to make me consider never using the Holiday Inn Express chain again!

__label__very_positive	The hotel was just right. Perfect location right downtown, easy walking distance to a half dozen very good restaurants and plenty of shops.

__label__neutral	Hotel was good. Friendly service and the room wasn't bad, but had minimal flaws. Found a couple bugs in the room, nothing horrible. Had a faint smell to it, and a few of the outlets didnt work. Overall stay was good though. Hotel had a full bar, and a resteraunt. Only thing i didnt like, and i know all hotels are like this but this one seemed like it was worse, was that you can hear everything outside the room. People kept walking by the room threw the night talking and can hear everything they were talking about.

Howard Johnson is the only hotel chain (and we have stayed in many other hotels)that allows their guests to open the room window or patio doors. I wish the sliding door of our room would have been in its frame and not hanging away from the frame so we could have enjoyed fresh air in our room. It was a lovely night to have the door open.

__label__very_negative	Old facility with parking far away from room. Food was cold. Staff goofed up our billing , resulting in an hour and a half wait for them to clear it up- they obviously did not know what they were doing. Bed was old and mattress was so worn that we rolled to to center of it. Could not get the heat to turn down on the thermostat with no help from staff. Worst motel stay ever!

__label__very_negative	You only receive 1 towel for your entire stay. Lucky they had an extra for a third person. Housekeeping is once a week. You have to update your key card everyday, sometimes more than once a day. Guests are responsible for emptying their own trash. This is a motel that houses people for weeks at a time. Barricaded the door the first night.

__label__very_positive	Very cozy place and reasonably priced. Close to good restaurants and the drive to the slopes wasn't very bad at all. Would come back. The place was very well kept, dishes, coffee, microwave, toaster, refrigerator all included. We didn't bring our bathing suits so couldn't utilize the hot tub but it was pretty warm while we were there anyways.

The quality and sophistication of the rooms and deacutecor, the service and ultra attentive staff was a 10+. The premium rooms are pricy, however our experience is that the other comparable hotels were more expensive (600+) and not as refined. Our friends we traveled with felt the same and we plan to visit again next year.

__label__very_positive	Amazing! My husband and I were looking for a quiet but close to home BB to spend two nights after our Wedding, and we found the perfect place! John and Karen were wonderful and made our experience more than we could ask for. I am Gluten Free and Karen made sure that each breakfast included Gluten Free options for me from blueberry muffins and omelets to a brown sugar glazed grapefruit. The room was terrific (Smythe Room) it overlooked the back garden and swimming pool, had tons of windows to soak up the sun. We also loved the fact the Jacuzzi had a separate room with French doors. We will defiantly stay at the Bailey House again!
__label__very_positive	The remote control didn't have batteries, once I bought batteries and put them in the TV didn't work. The staff offered to steal TV from a vacant room. Also the bathroom door handle fell off, they seemed very overwhelmed for this week at travelers

Instead of walking the Quarter, we took a taxi most of the time. The rooms were European size meaning they we quite well done but very small.

__label__neutral	I haven't stayed at a Comfort Inn in a long time. Well, it was as I remembered- below standard. The lobby of this location was dirty ( carpet needed vacuuming, entry glass doors filthy. Room was standard and clean enough. No gym. I had to walk to another hotel to use there gym and it was aweful, but better than nothing. Carpet throughout the hotel in public areas looked liked it hadn't been vacuummed for several days, poor design. We couldn't imagine eating breakfast at this hotel due to its uncleanliness. I have to say the front desk staff were very nice ( no smiles though) and appeared to be really understaffed both days we were there. Management really needs to wake up to turn the conditions around before it's too late.

__label__neutral	The hotel was nice but the air conditioning would not cool the room. We told the front desk but they did not seem very concerned or offer any consideration for our discomfort.
__label__very_positive	It was lovely, and clean. So nice to have a firepace. The sea gulls overhead are noisey in the mornings (if you are planning to sleep in) There appears to be no elevator so while the second floor is lovely we did have to drag our bags up the stairs. We would definately stay there again but pack lighter.
__label__very_negative	Terrible Hotel
__label__neutral	Everything was great including staff but the entire hotel especially the rooms needed a deep carpet cleaning or better replace. Clean white socks were black after five minutes in room. Elevator was extremely slow and safety on door was broke, so as you were entering/exiting door would close even when blocked with luggage or kid !
__label__very_negative	This property is a horrible location in the middle of no where and near nothing. The front desk staff, particularly Jeanette and Sunny, are rude and discourteous.

__label__very_negative	Arrived at 10:30p after a long day of travel (12+ hours of driving). I was given a room that was in very poor repair, stinky, dirty, and extremely cold, around 45 degrees. Cranked up the thermostat and went to bed thinking the room would heat up. Woke up around 4 a.m. to a freezing room. Went to the front desk to ask for another room and was greeted by a very unfriendly employee she basically blamed me and said I should have let her know sooner. After trying to reason with her, I realized I was wide awake and I did not have the patience to move to another room anyway after being treated this way. I did not think I would be able to sleep in a dingy room anyway.

__label__negative	I would only stay the hotel if it was the last hotel in the city. It was smelly and old. The lobby is nothing like the hotel itself. I took alot of items with me daily just because the hotel was so rundown and I didnt trust it. If your looking for just somewhere to sleep because you have no other choice then go here. But if you want to enjoy sleep and feel comfotable in where your staying at night I wouldnt stay here.

__label__very_positive	I enjoyed every minute. The staff was super nice, always had a smile on their face even when I called the front desk at 1am. The hallways are clean and well kept. Not without blemishes, but 99 perfect. The room was not a duplex but had two floors. The floor space under the bedroom is set aside for, well I don't know, because its not somewhere to go. It does allow some separation if your staying long term. I completely enjoyed my experience at their hotel.

__label__very_positive	I have yet to have a less than excellent stay in over 6 visits to this hotel in the last 3 years. Rooms are very contemporary, extremely clean, spacious, and most important quiet. We were surprised by the hotel check-in clerk when he offered a jr. suite for no additional cost - BONUS! Wow - large dining table, modern living room furnishings, sliding split door into bedroom is what I expect from larger and more expensive hotels. All the modern amenities you would expect of a 5-star hotel are at this hotel. The 4th floor offers courtesy water and coffee every morning. Room service is also excellent, and prices are quite reasonable in light of the current money exchange rates between pesos and dollars. Housekeeping is quick with delivery for more towels, and hair dryer as requested in our last trip to this hotel. Hotel is located 2 floors above the Parque Alameda Shopping mall with several quick service restaurants you would expect in the U.S., a bank, bookstore, coffee shop, sporting goods store. You could stay in the hotel and visit the shops and spend your weekend there and not be bored, but you would then miss the sights and sounds of Mexico City. Definitely will return soon.
__label__negative	The hotel room has a beautiful view of the ocean, and is very convenient to board-walk and eateries. However, we were not impressed with the condition of the hotel in general. It's a bit outdated and could use some remodeling work. Room was fairly clean whe we arrived other than forgetting to pick up the cup of cig buts left on the balcony. Room service was also less to be desired. The made the bed and provided towels.....no sweeping or collecting garbage. We would not stay here when we return. I'd rather pay a little more for a Marriot or Sheraton .

I was in town for a funeral Sunday and Monday. Saturday night I was awaken at 2:30 am by a wedding party that booked rooms side by side my room while they were drinking and talking loudly in the hallwaymoutside my room door, at least a dozen of them. I called the front desk for someone to tell them to go to their rooms, nothing happened , so after 30 minutes I got up and asked them please to keep it down. Old hotel, not much of a continental breakfast, old sheets and bedding, stiff mattresses, paid less from other motels and got better in past, but most places in area are over $100 a night, I booked for 4 night, better to pay over a $100 a night a get a quieter more comfortable bed.
__label__positive	We just finished our stay for an event at the convention center. We really liked the location, the breakfast and the happy hour.

__label__very_negative	One week before our stay, we were canceled with no place to stay. After some research we were able to find another place, more money for Wednesday through Monday. We then had to fine another place for Monday night.
__label__positive	The hotel is very nice and the location is excellent. The fact that it is the combination of two hotels makes it very difficult to navigate through. Also, the floors are not at the same level so when our elevator reached our floor we had to climb some stairs to get to the other building. The personnel is nice but the overall atmosphere is stuffy. Restaurant is overrated and pricey. Before signing the bill we were told by the maitre'd that the tip was not included when it's not customary to leave tips in Italy.
__label__very_positive	Family of 5, stayed 2 nights. Great location. Great Free Breakfast. Good indoor heated pool. Clean facility and courteous/helpful staff
__label__very_positive	Went up for a family visit. The room was clean and the staff friendly. Had a good meal in the restaurant. Convenient to stores of you forget anything.
__label__very_positive	Long overdue review but here it is. In a but shell: - Ernesto was awesome at the front desk, good info and made us feel welcome. He made my stay truly a beautiful ending to my bday celebration. -Kevin the bellmen was very pleasant and very attenative. -Room was great and clean! - Quiet away from the party noisey strip. Anyone can get a good night's sleep staying here. - The weather was cold (feb '16) for anyone to take a dip in the water (pool or beach) but as an added super surprise,1of the 2 pools were heated! It was truly great! Suggestions to hotel: invest in new beach towels and new drinks menu. Other than that, experience was awesome! Most highly likely to come back definitely!
__label__neutral	Stayed at this hotel because of it's location. Furnishings were only average, and there were no local meal discounts which I have had at other H.I.'s. On the plus side the room was very quiet. Had dinner at the local Fatz which I enjoyed
__label__positive	Adequate for overnight stay
__label__positive	Lovely location and enjoyable stay. Close to all we were looking to see and do. Usually only choose hotels that include breakfast but made an exception in this case because of the river front location.
__label__negative	Room was okay and clean. Building was noticeably old. Pool was very small and not clean. Hot tub was dirty and unusable. Okay place if your just looking for a bed to sleep in.
__label__very_positive	Wonderful
__label__very_negative	The room was SO gross! Mold all over the ceiling in the bathroom. There was a dog bone that was not ours left on the chair in our room...just all around gross!

__label__positive	I reserved this room as a stopover on a long trip. I arrived late (after 10 pm) and was pleasantly pleased that it took about a minute and a half to check in. The rooms have exterior entrances, and there is a ramp up to the second floor which is convenient. The room was big and clean with fridge and microwave. Sink and mirror separate from shower. The hairdryer wasn't working in the morning and when I reported it, I received another one in about 5 minutes. It isn't fancy, but it was a pleasant surprise. No complaints.

__label__positive	The Grand Hotel Cadenabbia is a magnificent old building, but the current owners seem to be running it into the ground. The facility was extremely poorly maintained, the room was in very bad condition, the staff were adequate, but hardly what one would expect for such a grand place. The location is right on Lake Como, but there is a lot of traffic out the front of the building. Until the owners start updating and repairing the facility, there are better choices in the Como area.
__label__very_positive	Aaa+++++
__label__positive	ROOM 330 HAS BED BUGS!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__positive	Location is not in Eugene - it's between Eugene Springfield and in an industrial area, next to a noisy road. Comfy beds, large room layout - it's like having your own studio apartment. Weather permitting, the river is right across the street, with a nice walking path. View on river side is lovely. Love being able to do the laundry after a long vacation - no cost. Also like the option of no daily room service if you don't need it. It's like living in an apartment building with amenities. No daily breakfast, but the built in modern kitchen allows you to cook anything you like - fully furnished.

__label__neutral	Good value for the price. Hotel staff was friendly and room was clean. I would say it's a solid 3 star. Breakfast included was also a nice perk.
__label__negative	The room was damp and musty smelling. The carpet was wet, and it took awhile to get it to dry by putting the heat on. One of the days we saw the house keepers cleaning other rooms and they were spraying the floor (probably why the floor were wet, but not sure the reason behind it). The staff were nice.

__label__positive	Good for the age of unit
__label__negative	For what we paid for our night at this hotel we found it just okay. This place is very dated. The carpet in our room had large stains and it felt like you were walking over huge bumps in it. We had a ground floor room and it sounded like the person overhead was picking up his luggage and bouncing it off the floor. This continued until well after 11:30 pm.
__label__neutral	Try the Rib eye. It is the best
__label__very_positive	One night stay
__label__neutral	Nice place to stay . Very convenient to restraints and general shopping
__label__very_positive	Don't read how great this place is!
__label__positive	The bathroom has no vent so the room totally fogs up when showering. The rooms seem small but adequate. The breakfast was lousy. Has anyone from Hampton eaten those eggs The staff was fantastic
__label__neutral	When I arrived, there was no parking. I told the girl at the front desk that I had a handicap and she still told me to try to the parking along the river or across the street. She never offered to help with my bags. I ended up leaving my car at the check in isle for about an hour until my daughter arrived and parked it for me. Remote control for the TV did not work. Could connect to the internet but because it was so slow, I could not even download my email!

__label__positive	Cheap as far as boston in concerned. Clean, good location, helpful staff. The heater wouldnt turn off though which was extreemly annoying. They gave us direction which we followed but it would not turn off. Bed was ok.
__label__negative	The hotel was in a nice area, but the pool was not heated and very very cold to my baby whom wanted to swim! And to top it off, my family and I are Native American and to have staff members watch us as we swam and sat in the jacuzzi was uncalled for!!!! We felt discriminated against for them assuming we were going to destroy their property! Ugh! Oh and the cleaning staff are Very Rude! Tried being nice and saying hello or excuse me and they give you a mean look and say something under their breath! I think this will be the only time we stay there!
__label__neutral	Close to family
__label__very_positive	I was getting settled in, and turned the television on, nothing....this tv is about 10 years newer than what I have, so I asked the front desk if there was a special way I need to do to turn it on. There were two women at the front desk and the one who told there is nothing we can do at this late hour threw her pen in an upset manner... so I just said thank you and went back up to my room. I forgot something in my car and as I was passing the lobby the same woman asked If I wanted another room, well she wrote it on a piece of paper as she was on the phone. Great room, very nice amenities

__label__very_positive	I've been to the Lobby twice, once on Friday and again on a Monday. Friday was crowded with lots of noise, people, and goings on. Just what you want on a FridayMonday it was sedate, almost serene. Just what you want on a date. My lady friend and I had the short ribs to warm up, then I had the Lobby burger and she had the pork tenderloin. Other than a little too much onion on my burger, the food was superb My date who is normally hard to please was giddy (she doesn't cook and she wanted the recipe).
__label__very_positive	Another nice stay at the Savoy. Great staff, quiet, relaxing atmosphere, steps from the beach or from everything in SoBe. Breakfast on the pool deck is a real treat. Only issue is that the ventilation system is out of date. It works well, but only for AC or heat it would be nice just to be able to turn on the fan.
__label__very_positive	Had a great stay at an awesome rate. Front desk staff was very helpful! Hot tub was great, and the room was comfortable and clean. Hot breakfast was awesome, loved the waffles and biscuits and gravy. :)Dear Valued Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write a review on your recent stay, your feedback is greatly appreciated.

__label__very_positive	I will definitely be booking a stay here next time I'm in town. The bed was comfortable and the amenities in the room were wonderful to have.

__label__positive	Stayed for three days at this hotel. the rooms were very clean and comfortable. The hotel is close to everything you may need. the hotel staff was friendly and helpful. Though it appears to be an older hotel it was very clean. Would stay there again.
__label__negative	Geared up for visitors traveling through. Everything is just about OK but not necessarily a pleasure. They provide just enough to get by and it is very clean but with a few changes they could make it much more inviting and satisfying.
__label__negative	I got a good deal on my room however, the air conditioning barely kept the room cool even when I lowered it to 60 degrees. Additionally, there was not a microwave or fridge in my room. The cleaning staff did a good job on my additional days at the hotel ,however when I first arrived, there was hair in the bed... not from me. The hotel restaraunt was clean and the staff were friendly, however the menu was not great and featured too many fancy options and not enough regular food. The hotel also had an odd smell on different floors. My floor was fine however since you have to travel to different floors to get ice or snacks, you get to experience all of the weird smells . Also don't go to your room thirsty because you'll have to go down to the lobby and across yo the arena lobby to get a cold water or soft drink.
__label__positive	Great location
__label__positive	My sisters an I did a weekend get-away to visit a cousin and to do some shopping in the area. Two years ago, we stayed at the Days Inn next door and saw them working on the Best Western, so we thought we'd give it a try. We got a GREAT price online for a Queen double w/Frig microwave! The rooms were comfortable clean!!!!! and the service was very good. The complimentary breakfast was also veery good for complimentary. The eating area was nicely arranged and a portion of it doubled as a sitting/waiting area. My only complaint is that some people have no home training. If you're given a complimentary breakfast, the least you can do is throw away your trash. Many of the hotel's guests DID NOT! Even though the workers did their part to keep the tables area clean, some of the guests were slobs and acted as if they paid for the meal, left at tip and deserved to have someone cleaning up behind them. I hope that the quality of service the hotel don't suffer because of people like that. My heart went out to the workers.
__label__very_positive	Great place to stay. Lovely breakfast
__label__positive	The hotel was close to the airport. I arrive very late at night. The staff was very friendly. My only complaint is that when I walked into my room, I walked into a freezer. Someone left the a/c on full blast. It didn't take long though for it to warm back up once I shut it off. Overall, it was a good stay.

__label__neutral	When we arrived at our hotel room after a very long journey, we were really disappointed with our room. The decor is in dire need of updating, as well as the bathroom. The hotel prides itself on water conservation but there was an archaic hot water tank in the bathroom and we had to wait for water to be heated up before we could all have showers. Breakfast was in a better place but in a separate building and the courtyard made up for the grim rooms.

__label__very_positive	Kids enjoyed the pool facilities. Restaurant, Bar, and room service meals were nice. Lake was relaxing and fun.
__label__very_positive	Nice, clean stay.
__label__very_positive	if you drive a car, then you shuld feel comportable and meet nice front desk. Most of all, my family colud have good sleep on the very nice bed and bedclothes. Near from the hotel, very good restaurants are there. Don't worry about your breakfast and dinner with walking.
__label__very_negative	Omg where do I begin. Holes in the wall, ripped up carpet, wood furniture had holes in it. There was mold on the shower curtain, the shower curtain would not close all the way it kinda hung in the middle of the curtain rod because the rod was not firmly connected to the wall. The water never got hot, very poor water pressure.The towels were stained. Very dimly lit. The staff would sit on their cell phone talking while I was standing there waiting to ask for a wash cloth. I was then told someone would be by in a moment to deliver one. Never came. The door had a wide gap, wide enough to let a cold breeze in.

__label__neutral	Well, this is so much less than I expect in an IHG property. The room basically is just a small step above a room at the Value Place.

__label__neutral	Good relationship between price and quality because we booked online. If we had not, the prices are too expensive for the room we had. I asked for a double bed and I had 2 single beds. It was ok because there was a discount. Positive point: close to the RER and metro station.

__label__very_positive	Everything was great and we had a nice stay. A tad disappointed that when we checked out our paperwork was no where to be found. I was assured that it was either filed the night before or was accidentally shredded. We wished there was ice in the breakfast area rather than going to the other side of the building for it (I like ice in my coffee)but that was a minor detail.

__label__very_positive	Very nice!
__label__very_positive	Great value in Bossier City
__label__very_positive	I was EXTREMELY pleased with this hotel. Given the price, my expectations were low so I was pleasantly surprised when we arrived. Room was very clean, nicely appointed and the staff was friendly. The beds were comfortable and quiet. There as a college track team at the hotel as well as quite a few high school aged volleyball teams. The ooms were situated so that it was not a problem and we didn't hear a sound. The beds were outstanding and I slept great (which is rare for me at hotels). The only downside was the lack of restaurants and the neighborhood. Because its right off the highway the management doesn't have a lot of control over the kind of characters in the area. Overall, I would stay here again without hesitation and the price makes it an unbelievable deal.

__label__positive	Hotel bom, j um pouco antigo, isolamento acstico no muito bom, quarto grande, com sala separada, cozinha completa, excelente caf da manh. A cama achei um pouco desconfortvel, pois o colcho revestido com uma capa de plstico grosso, que faz barulho e duro, que compromete o conforto. Pessoal profissional e seco, penso que poderiam ser um pouquinho mais cordiais. A limpeza do banheiro precisa ser melhor realizada.
__label__very_negative	Water was off when trying to take morning shower. Room located where door opened into crowded RV park. Breakfast was cold sweet rolls and coffee only. Out of 5 hotels we stayed in, this was the most expensive and the worst.

__label__positive	Everything was good, free breakfast was excellent!
__label__positive	Son was attending camp at the Naval Academy. Overall hotel is nice, off main road on private drive. Nothing within walking distance but shops and restaurants close by. Hotel staff needs to stay on top of breakfast as the food ran out for the number of guests eating. It was a little crazy.
__label__negative	The train behind the hotel was horrible when trying to sleep
__label__negative	the hotel may be providing long term stays for some people.
__label__very_positive	We checked in close to midnight and they were very accommodating to the fact we were so late for our check in. Throughout our 3 day stay we felt right at home. The room was clean and well maintained. We will be staying here again next time we visit!

__label__very_positive	We loved our stay at Villa Carlotta. It was impecable and had all the amenties you could ever need. The staff was so attentative to our every need. We stayed in apartemnt one which I could have lived in for months! It had plenty of room and was very comfortable, with plushy towels, bathrobes, refridgerator, fresh fruit, cofee maker, and more. The breakfasts at Villa Carlotta were just simply outstanding! We liked that it was a little bit on the fringe of Taomina and just a quick walk to the main street.
__label__very_positive	Good value
__label__neutral	The only thing that I did not like was the parking. But, I understand that parking at the beach is hard to come by. Not a deal breaker. I would stay here again. I enjoyed the friendly staff!!! From the people at the front desk to the those that cleaned the rooms, everyone was so friendly. Any time that I saw an employee in the hall they were sure to say hello. This was my first time staying in a Holiday Inn Express and I plan to visit again.
__label__very_positive	Modern next to the Casino Downtown Shops
__label__positive	It was a nice and clean hotel. In our room above us the floors were squeezing and the person above paced all nigh. Kept me up. Service was friendly.
__label__very_negative	Very worn down hotel. Room had a bad smell, was dark with only a tiny window, cigarette burn in bed. The double was a joined set of twins, old mattresses and very uncomfortable. We booked for 3 nights, but quickly cancelled and left after one.
__label__very_positive	Its a older hotel but very nice. Showers were great and well stocked kitchen. We paid $69 for one night but arrived at 1:00 am so that may be why we got a good rate. Ck out is 11 but they let us stay till 12 at no charge. We would stay here again if the opportunity arises.
__label__positive	I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. I travel quite a bit and this hotel was one of the better one's I have used. The staff was helpful when I accidently left my key in my room and I got another one within minutes of asking. The hotel is near town and the prison (where I needed to be for a training). There is also a nice restaurant/sports bar where the food is good and the prices are reasonable. I would recommend this, however, request a room on the side away from the train at the back.
__label__positive	Overnight stay with my 20 yr old daughter to take back stuff from college. Loved the spaciousness of room and layout. Appearance and cleaniness were positives. Did not like the bath tub which maintained a constant trickle of water after use the whole night. Other negative was complimentary breakfast. The muffins, donuts, and waffle wedges were extremely stale. Fake eggs not good. Fruit not very good. Didnt eat much as a result. So, the 2 negatives tell me to find a better hotel next time in SA.
__label__very_positive	Comfortable
__label__very_negative	Management
__label__positive	It was very difficult to regulate the air in the room - it was either too cold or too hot as soon as the ac changes to auto. The location is excellent. You can enjoy the beach from the comfort of your own patio! The staff was very friendly and accommodating.
__label__neutral	Hotels.com patrons offered lesser amenities
__label__positive	We stopped on our trip back to Texas, very clean place to stay, friendly staff. It was quiet even though we were on the first floor.

__label__very_negative	Mystay was awful. This hotel needs to be shut down and burnt to the ground. The rooms was mildewed and smelled awful. Every single room we encountered had BEDBUGS and they refused to give us a refund for our unpleasant stay. PLEASE REMOVE THIS HOTEL FROM HOTELS.COM this was awful.
__label__positive	Needed something close to my in-laws, this perfectly fits the bill.

__label__positive	Every thing is great, except the shower water is not hot enough. Breakfast is good for this hotel price.
__label__negative	Overall, the room was fine. We weren't expecting anything special anyway as we weren't planning to spend much time in the room. However, the room wasn't really that clean. There were fingerprints all over the microwave, lamps, etc. which was pretty gross. As for the hotel itself, I would probably stay there again if it was the same price. We had free wifi, cable, and continental breakfast. We only paid $55 a night and you can't really beat that. The location was really good. It was close to shops and restaurants as well as the people we were visiting.
__label__very_negative	I made reservations 4 dinner w/ 6 friends. We arrived 2 Lobby Twelve where we were seated in the very back of the restaurant ALONE. The lighting temperature were much darker colder than the rest of the restaurant..strike 1. Our server greeted us asked us if we needed drinks. Very optimistic, we all ordered drinks. She placed our order for drinks the bar actually WAITED 4 them to finish instead of coming back taking our food orders..this took 20 min...strike 2. She came back w/ our drinks we placed our dinner order. Afterwards, she went MIA again until our food came out..strike 3. Meanwhile our drinks water were empty When our food arrived we informed her that we needed more drinks water refills. She went to get the drinks again we didnt see her 4 another 20 min..strike 4. When she came back w/ the drinks she dropped them off immediately fled the scene w/o asking us how our food turned out..strike 5. We ate our food my friends that had problems w/ their food regretfully ate theirs 2. About 20minutes later, the MGR came over 2 ask us about service. Not wanting to get the waiter in trouble we laughed it off waited 4 our check. Another 20min passed we flagged down the MGR confessed of the bad service said we needed our check...strike 6. He apologized had the server bring us our check. She slammed the check down on the table, rolled her eyes walked off. That was it..strike 7. We went found the MGR told him what happened. We had a 300 bill 50 of it was her gratuity tip We couldnt let this happen The MGR adjusted her tip off our total sent her back over to collect the money. She was really pised now. It took 1 hr to cash our table out when we tried to see why, she stood the register w/ another waiter told him 2 stay nearby bcause she may need back up 2 handle these biches OMG I couldn't believe it. Then her MGR walked over, she asked me why did we say we had bad service...in front of him SPEECHLESS

__label__negative	The ceiling was water stained. The shower curtain had lots of mold. The floor and furniture were not clean. Not a pleasant stay.
__label__neutral	The room is clean enough, with a decent bed and tiny bathroom. Basically a serviceable room at a fairly high price. When we checked in our agent was efficient but the manager Bonnie was checking in another guest next to us and both my wife and myself felt that she was very rude to another guest who had special request and she didn't want to help this person out at all.
__label__positive	Great Stay at the Cadenabria!
__label__negative	We had a problem with our air conditioner not getting below 24.5c which is 76.1 way to warm, especially after coming in from 100 outside. Someone came and changed the filter which was black is was so dirty, and did something else but nothing changed. The staff was very friendly, but I think that is just Italians. One afternoon we asked for a breakfast to go because we had an early adventure, they said they couldn't do it. We went down earlier another day thinking they opened and they were setting up, but they would let us take a couple of croissants, even though those were out. He did let us go in 10 minutes early when he realized we waiting. The breakfast room was so hot it was almost to much to stay to eat. But the breakfast spread was good. (We travel a lot and have never had a hotel not accommodate that.) The location is excellent. Easy walk to most parts of the city as well as the train station. They did arrange a day trip for us. Asked for a late departure and they said no, even though our housekeeping did come to our room until 4:00 the day before. On the last day a couple of the girls finally started to loosen up when my husband was joking around with them, and when we got back to our room a little while later they called and have given us our late check out. During check out we found out they were having air conditioning problems building wide. They should have just told us.

__label__very_positive	We had a lovely week of complete rest. Lazing in the sunshine, dipping into either the pool or the sea, no driving or cooking or phones. The setting was beautiful and the staff were great plus the food was fantastic. Although we are a 'mature' couple and there were a lot of families there we were always able to find a quiet area if we wanted to.
__label__positive	Great value!
__label__positive	The room was spacious and comfortable, and we enjoyed our stay. The hotel was on great location, in the city center. The breakfast was really good and variable. Cons were that there was no fridge in the room and there was only one working socket in the room.
__label__very_positive	I chose this motel based on price other good reviews. It was an excellent choice. While this is an older motel in the center of a small town, everything was spotless, the room, the lobby, even the parking lot. I would recommend this motel to anyone visiting North Platte Nebraska.

__label__positive	Stayed here with my wife for a recent business trip. It was a very convenient location to where I needed to travel for work everyday. The staff was very helpful and courteous. I would definitely stay here again in the future.
__label__neutral	The hotel is very close to the marina and has a great view if you get a balcony room. The hotel hallway smelt like dirty diapers .... I would recommend couples find a local adult only spot. This hotel would be good for families looking to vacation together. I wasn't impressed with the restaurant, pool of any hotel amenities for the price I paid. I felt like the hotel was more of a 3-star atmosphere and definitely overpriced. Bonuses about the hotel is that it's about 35-45 minutes from downtown Austin. There are plenty of stores and eateries nearby so you can go grab food and drinks outside the hotel to avoid the high pricing. My room key didn't work the first night we checked in, it was a pain to go back upstairs to get another key. I wasn't given any amenities or accommodations about the hotel so you certainly want to ask. Also, I was charged for spa services that I didn't use so you want to double check your bill before you leave.

__label__neutral	The staff did not acknowledge me or my family. There were times there was nobody at the desk to assist. One of my family members had booked way in advanced and paid and when got there her reservation was given to someone else by a female manager called tanner. This made me not want to ever stay in this hotel. I also didn't understand how the house keeper was the only one with a key to acess the towels. My other family member did not get house keeping during the whole day.
__label__positive	Good Location and Comfortable Rooms!
__label__positive	Good location for west Milwaukee area.
__label__positive	This is a newer hotel located on the outskirts of town. As such, there is very little landscaping, so not much curb appeal. The staff seem friendly, but apparently are not able to make decisions without consulting a supervisor. The rooms are very nice not too large, but comfortable for a short stay. They do have pet friendly rooms with is a plus for us. My main concern with the hotel is pricing. It is very over-priced for the Riverton, WY market. I uses Expedia points to lower the cost or I would have passed.

Aufenthalt mit Hund war mglich und wurde sogar mit einer kleiner Aufmerksamkeit fr den Vierbeiner noch verschndert. Das Frhstck war sehr lecker und hatte eine reichhaltige Auswahl. Alles war sehr sauber und ordentlich. Lediglich an der Rezeption war ein Mitarbeiter sehr berheblich und patzig. Zuerst wurden wir eingewiesen und es wurde uns ein Parkplatz zugewiesen. Nachdem wir bereits standen und uns auf in den Ortskern machen wollten, hielt uns der Mitarbeiter an und teilte uns mit, dass wir nun pro Nacht fr den Parkplatz 15 zahlen mssten. Auf Nachfrage, warum uns das denn nicht vorher mitgeteilt worden sei, bekamen wir die patzige Antwort, dass das jawohl berall steht und auch auf der Website zu finden sei. Meine Meinung Selbst wenn - ein kundenfreundlicher Mitarbeiter htte 1.) freundlicher Reagiert und 2.) aus Servicegedanken in jedem Fall vorher nochmal darauf hingewiesen. Leider haben wir uns den Namen des Mitarbeiters nicht gemerkt. Die anderen waren jedoch alle sehr freundlich und deutlich hilfsbereiter als dieser eine. Alles in Allem kann man einen Aufenthalt hier sehr empfehlen - wenn man sich ggf. ber die ntigen Informationen selbst und im Vorfeld erkundigt.

__label__very_positive	A very good fine
__label__positive	Comfort without Biting your Wallet
__label__very_positive	Love the town of Wheeler. The hotel is quaint and love the atmosphere! Very romantic.
__label__very_positive	The best part about this hotel was the customer service. The hotel was clean, well maintained, and easy to locate. I would definitely stay at this hotel again when visiting family in the area. Thank you Linda for making the hotel a very pleasant stay.
__label__very_positive	Will be staying here again.
__label__very_positive	It is a great family hotel, with spacious suite rooms, a great pool, and close proximity to Disneyland.
__label__very_negative	Audrey at the front desk seemed annoyed that I wanted a room as she had other things to do.  Not rude, but very curt. Room is OK at best.  First and last stay here for me.
__label__neutral	The room was clean but there was no hot water. We used to stay at this hotel frequently in the '90s but it is looking pretty worn down now.
__label__positive	Staff were friendly but room ambiance was cheap. Services poor. No tea cofeebmaking facilities, no internetbin rooms, no drinks or food room service. Dinner very expensive and not much in quantity. Room view spectacular. Would go back for view and size of room.
__label__positive	Das Resort hat keinen Strandzugang wie der Name Cliff Resort ja auch transparent wiedergibt. Alles sehr sauber und fr den Preis recht komfortabel. Kann man gut empfehlen. Die Aussicht aus dem Pool ist sensationell.
__label__very_positive	Spacious, good service, close to an airport and to main attractions. All rooms have a bedroom and a living room accompanying the bedroom. There is a gym on site. Breakfast is included in the reservation.
__label__positive	Our experience was pleasant. As soon we went to our room we the wash basin would not drain. We told the desk and we were moved to a new room. No problem.
__label__very_positive	This bed breakfast is gorgeous and comfortable down to the slightest detail. Our room was lovely, the food delectable, the staff attentive, friendly and happy to assist.

__label__neutral	nice location, too much noise
__label__positive	Still good but need a refreshment
__label__positive	Clean, safe, hotel for a very reasonable price. Not fancy but comfortable and close to the strip. Free breakfast was a nice touch. Breakfast was assorted cereals, toast, bagels, donuts, sausage, biscuits smd gravy, assorted juices coffee.
__label__very_positive	Great value!
__label__positive	Location, location, location. Business or pleasure if you are going to D.C. and don't want to deal with D.C., Alexandria is the place and this Hotel is in the middle of everything. The have valet parking for $27 a day but right next to Madeline's(across the street) is a garage that cost $10 a day. Everything was clean, staff was helpful. Lobby was kind of small but the bar is right next door. Complimentary coffee in the a.m. and complimentary wine in the p.m.
__label__very_positive	when we arrive , MR PATEL, greets us with a smile and warm cookies and coffee in the lobby. nice clean rooms, fresh bed linens. the electric system works well with the card key. when you enter, you place your card key in a slot for your electric, when you leave ..the lights go off. very energy efficient hotel.
__label__negative	The room was clean and the bed was okay. The girl that first checked us in was great and so where most of the others. There was one that just was not accommodating at all. It truly ruined the stay. The location was good. The breakfast was lacking. I guess we probably would not stay here again. I feel bad writing this but it is the truth. Maybe they will improve in the future. I was impressed that they did shampoo the hallways while we were there. It meant that they did care about the Motel.
__label__very_positive	Short ,but nice stay
__label__very_negative	UNJUSTIFIED
__label__positive	Nice place, close to freeway but quiet. I liked the inviting fireplace as you enter to register. The friendly staff eager to please. I would stay here again.
__label__positive	Only complaint would be the unavailability of an ADA room, made bathing very difficult for my wife. This may have been an issue of not being able to make the request on the website when I booked, rather I had to call ahead and found it was not available. The first floor room we were given was nice, was kept clean and the management was very apologetic and made efforts to help whenever they could. Perhaps the website could be modified to correct this issue. Thank You !

__label__very_positive	My wife and I found our stay very comfortable, the facility was just off the Interstate, parking was good. Resrurants for dinner and breakfast were close at hand.

__label__very_negative	since you were under constuction, the part with the walkway torn up should not have been in use. The elevator did not work with our room key- had to go back to desk to get help. Your small sign set back from road makes it hard to see to find the place.
__label__very_positive	I had an appointment the next morning nearby so this place worked well. Quiet, front desk service was great and the free breakfast was a little above average based on cleanliness and taste. If you are staying for business, this is a great hotel too and not far from places to eat and there's a restaurant inside too. I didn't eat there, but the smell of the food was good.
__label__very_positive	Clean and Neat place
__label__positive	Beds too soft. Breakfast could have been better. Parking space is limited and tight. Nice location. Clean sheets. Great view.
__label__very_positive	Nice find in Ogunquit
__label__negative	Location without any extras.
__label__neutral	Beautiful hotel with spacious comfortable room, but after a 3 hour flight I was unable to get s nightcap. The bar closed over an hour early. Quite disappointing.
__label__very_negative	The pictures that were shown at while I made my booking was quite deceptive. The rooms were cramped, the bathrooms were narrow and has no exhaust. The telephone in our room did not work. The breakfast that was included were below standard and no staff to even fill out empty juice container. The room carpet seems that it is in dire need of a steam vacuum or some serious cleaning. and there is no elevator. Lastly, there is no elevator.

__label__very_positive	I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the Super 8 much nicer than any other Super 8 I'd stayed at in the past. However, we had a room with 2 double beds and those beds were NOT double. They were 1 and a halfs at best. My husband and I were unable to move without elbowing or kneeing the other person. The comfort would have been great had we each been able to have our own bed, but we were sharing the room with others.
__label__positive	Our stay was nice. The front desk staff was always pleasant. The breakfast was not as good as other La Quinta Inns. It was always a mess when you went to breakfast. There was not enough space for the breakfast room.
__label__very_positive	Great service from the motor lobby staff. Was there for a conference. The staff that serviced the conference was wonderful and helpful. Reserved a king bed from a third party site, and they gave it away, which was the only bummer.
__label__very_positive	the weekend breakfast buffet is outstanding!
__label__very_positive	Clean Rooms but could do with a refurb
__label__very_positive	Down with Down Comforters
__label__very_positive	This property is tucked away at the other end of hotel row on a main road so it feels quiet. Staff and rooms were very agreeable. I LOVE that our room had no carpet and felt more modern. There were ongoing renovations but nothing that disrupted our stay. Breakfast was tasty and a great variety. A nice place for families.

__label__very_positive	Excellant Stay
__label__negative	Good in a Pinch
__label__neutral	Good size suit for the 6 of us. Not a lot of extra space for walking around the room or to put a pack and play. The tv was in the center of the room so the other queen bed couldn't see the tv that well. It was clean, quiet, and pet friendly. The breakfast was standard with decent coffee. I would stay there again. The staff was accommodating and friendly.

__label__very_negative	MOST HORRIBLE HOTEL ON OUR VACATION.
__label__very_positive	The only small maintenance issue was some rusty discoloration on the steps in the stairwell by the lobby leading up to the second floor. Otherwise, the hotel was in great shape and the room was very comfortable. I was happy with the refrigerator, microwave, workspace, and cleanliness. The check in and check out process were great with friendly, helpful employees.
__label__very_positive	This hotel is located right off of I-55, so it was easy to find. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful during our stay. The beds were comfortable and the room was clean. Free breakfast is always a bonus, too.

__label__very_positive	Clean , efficient , staff was awesome , breakfast was really good for the hotel kind. I would gladly stay here again. Came in late and got a room next to stairs but we just turned on air conditioning and couldn't hear the people walking . So it was perfect.
__label__very_positive	We were looking for a place to just stay the night. The signs along the highway led us here. The rooms were a little more expensive, but they were very large and comfortable. The wifi connection was very good and the breakfast was good.
__label__positive	Good location for west Milwaukee area.
__label__negative	Just needed to get away for a night. Price for that great! Room- small and smelt. No extras. Of course we didn't pay for any. Staff was friendly. Close to many restaurants and bars. Sleep, have fun, eat and drink.

__label__positive	Great location but AC not adequate for August temperatures.
__label__positive	We enjoyed our stay at Pueblo Bonito Sunset. The rooms are clean and nice, there are a lot of swimming pools to choose from. The only thing is you cannot swim in the beach but you can go to their sister resort the Rose to swim in the beach. The food was good specially the Champagne brunch on Sundays. That Sunday brunch was very good. The only thing is that don't have nightly entertainment which is present in all all inclusive places I've been to.

__label__very_positive	This is an excellent hotel convenient by car to the city of Annapolis. The rooms are comfortable, the staff pleasant and helpful, the breakfast good. They have a useful business center, guest laundry, and other amenities.
__label__positive	A GREAT STORY
__label__very_negative	I reserved a room with the kitchenette. The first room i checked into had a bad smell and they were nice enough to get me another room. But the cook top didn't work, there were no shampoo and the towels were old. The price is way to high for the room.
__label__positive	Quiet, pleasant and very clean.
__label__neutral	We stayed in this pet friendly motel for several days because we were in town for a dog show. The staff was polite and the location was good. The room was clean with comfortable beds and great air conditioning. However, the room was quite small. So small in fact that I needed to leave my suitcase in the car as we had run out of room. Housekeeping also failed to clean our room one day - they came in and got the dirty towels off of the floor, but never replaced them with clean ones, make the beds, or empty the trash. The other thing that we found disappointing was having no trash receptacles on the property. As responsible pet owners who clean up after our dogs, there was no place to dispose of it, so we had to use the dumpster located at the neighboring bank parking lot. During the week there were many construction companies staying here who dominated the common area with cookouts and parties. I was glad that our room did not face the picnic (party) area.
__label__very_positive	we had a coupon from a travel center, and am never sure if there will be rooms available, but we checked in and got the coupons savings...location is good, room was great, what we expect from a quality inn. Breakfast was very good and ample, clerks were friendly..all in all, a quality experience
__label__very_negative	unbeatable views of Garden of the Gods quiet super comfortable
__label__positive	We stayed here for 1 night in October 2006. We arrived at 4pm (check-in is at 3pm) and had to wait 45 minutes to get a room. Normally, it wouldn't have been such a pain, however we had to meet some people within the hour. The hotel was nice, room and parking came to 200 for one night (seemed a little high). Overall, I would recommend once they clean up the check-in process.
__label__positive	It was comfy and nice. But the bed was uncomfortable. We could feel the springs. Didn't sleep well!
__label__very_negative	I met a very bad manner and unprofessional motel that I never met in the past. Also, they could add additional fee that I did not know their tricky policy different with Expedia's information I filled out.

__label__very_negative	I did not feel safe at all during my stay. The hotel staff was less than friendly and there is no elevator to the second floor. There was a gap you could easily see through when the door closed. A male I did not know tried to follow me into my room one night. I set the dead bolt each night and pushed desk and chair up against the door, since I did not feel safe with just the locks on the door. I had to stay 4 nights since my booking was non refundable. It was hard to know while booking online what type of hotel this would be. Next time I will read the reviews more carefully and spend the extra money to feel safe.

__label__very_positive	The Hotel Eugene en Ville was a very comfortable place to stay. Staff was extremely polite and helpful. The hotel is conveniently located between two Metro stops (Le Peletier and Cadet), so traveling around the city is quite easy. Restaurants in the area are good, and there are several small markets nearby also. The room was quite ample size for a hotel room in Paris, and nicely renovated. The bed was large and comfortable. I would gladly stay in this hotel again in the future.

The hotel has a parking garage with an entrance conveniently located just around the corner.  Not cheap at $29/night and a bit tight in spots, especially for large vehicles such as SUVs (we drive a Prius).  The staff were excellent and they had a decent fitness room--treadmills, elliptical and stationary bikes.  All-in-all, very happy with our experience.
__label__positive	Not bad for one night
__label__very_negative	Saving a few bucks isn't always worth it
__label__very_positive	I found it to be the best hotel within walking distance to the best Eugene has to offer. Close to good food, nite life the U of O campus. The best hotel on Broadway Blvd!!!
__label__positive	This was our 2nd time we stayed here. Great location, friendly staff and nice continental breakfast. My only comment is the soft bed. They need new mattresses. Otherwise, I highly recommend it!
__label__very_positive	We drove from Aurora, CO. About 4 hrs. The young lady was very nice, check in was fast. She gave some helpful advice because my son will be attending Colorado Mesa University and she also attends. The room was very clean, beds comfortable and the ac worked. Yeah!!!
__label__neutral	Motel entry area smelled but room was comfortable. Went to town for dinner... town was a dive, luckily found an Outback, next to Home Depot, behind the motel. Only decent place we saw to eat. Staff was courteous and eager to please. Offered a continental breakfast but would prefer some sealed food for those of us afraid of continental breakfasts...
__label__positive	Good vaue.
__label__very_positive	This is by far best place to stay within 20 miles of Princeton. We were wanting a queen room with a rollaway and the front desk hooked us up with an amazing Super sized Queen room with a hideaway couch and lots of extra room. The price ended up being the same as we would have paid for the standard... More
__label__very_positive	The reason I stay at La Quinta is for their exceptional service and the quality of the accomodations. This stay was great because it was a newly renovated facility and everything was clean, new and functional. I recommend that if you're in the area, you drop into the Calhoun La Quinta. You're sure to be pleased.

__label__very_negative	Great View from room 6th floor. Was very disappointed in the hotel for the amount of money that I paid.

__label__very_positive	Texas Comes To Town
__label__neutral	Bad things: Toilet was malfunctioning on my arrival, there was no tv remote, I found a pair of boxers under the trash liner in the trash can (seriously), there was a soaked washcloth on the floor, the room was so hot that I had to sleep with the noisy fan unit on all night that blew the shades open and let street lights in, disrupting my sleep. Good things: large room, very friendly and helpful staff, quiet hotel, large and pretty comfortable bed.
__label__positive	This is a newer Hampton with the modern 2 story high breakfast area- very good breakfast options- we made a Texas shaped waffle- cute!! Ask for room away from highway- just a little noise from traffic- not many food options nearby .
__label__neutral	My husband and I booked our room for local events. When we checked in, we loaded up our cart full of our belongings and headed up to Floor 9. When I entered the room, I was unsure what to think. The bed was messy, garbage all over, used towels on the bathroom floor, etc. We truly thought we walked into the wrong room, it looked like someone was still staying in there, so we bolted quick! I had my husband be my look out just in case and I snapped a few pictures. We then headed back down to the front desk to let them know and they ended up moving us to a new room on the 14th floor and gave us one free breakfast... There are two of us. We got to our new room on the 14th floor, and I went in to take a shower. Needless to say, it wasn't perfect but with it only being myself and my husband it wasn't a huge deal but the bathroom door wouldn't close.
__label__very_positive	Staff and service make this property excellent! Beyond friendly and accommodating. Shuttle driver called me twice with updates on his status due to rush hour traffic delays and he was only 10min past original plan. It's a lovely 100 year old hotel downtown but updated in key furnishings like bathroom, shower, awesome beds in spacious rooms (even the basic king room). Only 2 hotels (cheaper but yuck) closer to airport and this one will now always be my choice to stay again! Outside of rush hour, it's barely 10min to airport-very convenient. The restaurant food is outstanding--they're somehow connected with a culinary institute so menu isn't vast but quality everything. Shrimp grits and ham Mac cheese TDF!
__label__positive	We needed a decent place to stay for the night while at a convention. This is close enough to the DCU center to be a good choice, but far enough away to be more affordable. The staff was friendly, especially for our early check out.
__label__very_positive	Clean comfortable room, friendly staff, easy access to Monterey (with a car).

__label__positive	Hotel looks beautiful on the outside, but the inside could use some work. The furniture and decor are all outdated. The bathroom was updated but the tub never was so it looks filthy. There was also a good amount of dust on top of the drapes. The beds were hard and not very comfortable. Not horrible overall as far as Cape hotels go, but a little updating would go a long way. The outdoor pool and beach were great. I like that the hotel supplied actual beach towels (very convienent). The toiletries provided by the hotel were great. Parking was also easy and location is central to restaurants and beaches.

We enjoyed breakfast the next day and were treated well by Shayla in the breakfast restaurant. We also appreciated the price of the stay at this Comfort Suite. Thank you!
__label__neutral	When visiting Portland, you don't have many choices for lodging. Given that, this Holiday Inn Express is a decent choice. Having stayed here multiple times, however, it seems that the rooms' cleanliness is hit-or-miss. When you check into your room, be sure to check for bed bugs and don't hesitate to request a room change.

__label__neutral	Mixed review: Slow check-in due to training the new desk clerk (she'll do fine once she has some experience). Both spas and one ice machine awaiting repair. Room clean and quiet. Bed saggy and not the sensation of stability that I hope for. Back step outside needs a yellow 'See This Step' marker - I was not the only one who nearly had a trip-and-fall. Good breakfast. And the unexpected and delightful treat of watching the hot air balloons up close in the open space back of the hotel on Sunday morning!

__label__negative	It was horrible... The whole time I was there they never came in and cleaned up or changed the trash and then the took money from my account without my knowledge which ruined the rest of my trip. They did not do anything but void the transaction. They were not customer friendly at all.
__label__very_negative	You get cheap room for cheap
__label__very_positive	The hotel is nice, well maintained, staff were friendly and overall pleasant stay for business people. It is not hotel for vacation. I gave the room cleaning only four stars because the vacuum cleaning was not perfect. I found some pieces of papers behind the chairs. Not big deal, I didn't complain about it, but they should take care about it better, I recommend this hotel for business users.

__label__very_positive	Peaceful and Relaxing
__label__positive	The hotel seemed recently updated, the beach was right across the street, and beach chairs were provided. Breakfast was great, wifi was good, all rooms have a little balcony, perfect for drying bathing suits.
__label__neutral	Room was nice and clean not much different than a room at Lumiere. Many different elevators to get to our room, must go up to 4 floors turn to the left turn left again and take that elevator to your room. Dark hallway leading to the casino, wouldn't walk it alone. Drinks are expensive, no breakfast included.
__label__positive	Very clean, great staff. Minutes from old town. Breakfast was great, lots of choices.
__label__neutral	I certainly don't have any real complaints about this Hampton. I have just stayed in nicer ones. It was a little older and the staff wasn't overly friendly, but it was clean and everything was in working order.
__label__negative	If you are looking for a suite at this hotel, there are none. If you are looking for three beds in a room, there are no such rooms. Ignore what Expedia says, they don't exist and you'll be screwed when you get there.
__label__positive	Trs bon htel de passage si vous tes plusieurs et trs bon prix avec le djener continental compris.

__label__positive	Nice Residence Inn - but in a rural area.
__label__neutral	Nothing stood out at this property. The staff were ho-hum, not overly friendly or nice, but not necessarily rude. The underwater light in the hot tub was hanging out and I had concerns that it might be dangerous to use the hot tub because of it. I asked the desk clerk and she said that it had been inspected by the health inspector and it was safe... it had been inspected, but not fixed Weird. Breakfast was bland and disappointing. A sign leading into the breakfast area said Breakfast Pizza! There was breakfast pizza, but it was burned on the edges and cold - not appetizing at all.
__label__neutral	We were disappointed we had no view of the water - it would be a minimum of 10-20 minutes walking to a place to see the water or reach a the beach. Our room was spacious and clean with a heavy smell of room deodorizer as we entered. The second day we fortunately returned as the room was being cleaned... More
__label__very_positive	My wife and I visited off season. Every member of staff, from reception to restaurant went out of their way to make us feel special. The hotel had lots of character, an incredible view to the sea, and was close enough to the town centre for walking but just far enough for peace and quiet. Breakfast was phenomenal. When we first checked in there were a couple of minor niggles in the room (leak in bathroom, faulty TV), however as soon as we told staff they moved us to a new room that was perfect, and were very apologetic. Five star service.
__label__neutral	Won't be back.
__label__very_positive	Wonderful resort
__label__negative	It was a last minute booking. Wish I would have done a little more research. There were visible signs of mold on the walls by the hot tube and on the entrance door. The chair in the room had stains.
__label__positive	Very clean and accessible Room was comfortable
__label__very_positive	I like the Palm Suites. I have stayed there a few times and enjoy it. One point that I think is worth pointing out. There was a hurricane on the way and they were great about taking care of us and keeping us safe. They understood the interruption of vacation, as well. I think it is worth pointing out so, I will say it again, they cared about our safety.

__label__very_negative	Horrible experience
__label__very_negative	Our family stayed at this Super 8 on the way back from our annual trip out West. I chose this location because it had 3 rooms available for our 9 travelers and its proximity to I-90. Had I not been tied to the reservation, I would have walked out during check-in. I always book through Hotels.com and have never had trouble. In this case, I was questioned repeatedly about our numbers and given numbers that did not include the children. When, in hopes to make sure I did not err in booking, I told the man at the counter the number including the kids, he said that our reservations would be more expensive. I protested and explained that we had 5 children in the group, he continued to grill me on our numbers. The whole process took 25 minutes. Not only was the barrage of questions belittling and rude, the man continued to tell me that his boss would take his job if he saw all of us the next morning. Surprise! The next morning, the boss was not in and the same person that checked us in was at the desk. I told him that I wanted to speak to the owner (about the check-in and the fact that 2 air conditioners were not working), he told me I couldn't. I told him I was very disappointed and he told me fine, just leave. I have stayed at Super 8's before and had no trouble. This experience has made me so angry that I have contacted the chain to let them know that this particular location was not representing its name well. I will never stay at the Worthington Super 8 again.
__label__positive	The front desk guys were awesome! Came in a little earlier and he made it possible that I check in earlier.

__label__neutral	Parking is a joke. Valet is at the other end of the casino from registration. We were handed ear plugs at check-in, due to all night noise from Freemont Street. Didn't use them, but it was unusual.
__label__very_positive	Good Place to Stay
__label__neutral	Great location and lovely views from the terrace where there was a fab selection of treats for breakfast, however the room was a real disappointment! It looked nothing like the lovely images on the website and was in a separate detached set of rooms a few metres from the main hotel, which when we checked in we weren't shown to and struggled to find our room, at midnight having carried all our bags unnecessarily up flights of stairs. The room was quite dark and furnished with very old fashioned furniture- not at all like the website, but maybe we were given that room because we only stayed one night and arrived late.

__label__neutral	Decent place, somewhat dated, and a strange musty smell
__label__positive	Stayed there for one night during a business trip. The staff was friendly and generally the room was clean (there was a large strand of hair on the bathroom ceiling).

__label__very_positive	Fabulous!!!!!
__label__negative	The bathroom had hair on the floor when we got there and throughout our stay. The service was poor long lines with never a second associate to help check in or out, though people were behind the counter. Their pool was being renovated and a nearby hotel was allowing guests to swim there, but that was never told to us. We heard it told to someone else while we were waiting to check out. You really get what you pay for with this one.
__label__neutral	Room....
__label__neutral	The motel was no frills, but fit perfectly with my budget. I found it easy to locate and it was easy to get to my final destination from this location. Even though the highway was closeby, I did not hear any noise from the highway in my room. I realized the morning after I left that I my cellphone had fallen out of my purse onto the floor of the room. When I called, the sweet lady on the phone said, Oh, yes, we have your phone. We were hoping you would call so we could make arrangements to send it back to you. I was so relieved.
__label__very_negative	Worst place ever
__label__neutral	Quick Stay in a Central Location
__label__negative	If you have kids or prefer to NOT be burnt badly by scolding hot water... do NOT stay here!I understand when you stay at a motel the water preasure isnt one to be desired however the water temperature should NOT go from a comfortable temp to scolding hot multiple times during a quick shower! I am so glad I was the one to get burnt first and not my kids or you'd be getting more than just a bad review! Also, we stayed when it was 109 degrees outside and the pool was out of order the entire time... get your s!t together! We ended up leaving early and staying at the best western next door which I highly recommend!

__label__neutral	Weder vor noch nach der Buchung wurde angegeben, dass das Hotel aus einem Haupt- und einem Nebengebude besteht, auch das Foto bei der Buchungsbesttigung zeigt nur das Haupthaus. Es htte zur Ehrlichkeit gehrt anzugeben, dass man im Nebenhaus untergebracht wird, in dem es weder Rezeption noch Bar gibt und die Treppen ganz furchtbar knarren. Das Zimmer war okay, doch das Bad hatte den Charme der 60iger Jahre und war klein. Das Personal beim Frhstck war sehr freundlich, ein Frhstcksei bekam man jedoch am 1. Tag nur auf Nachfrage. Beim Ausschecken ging es nur ums Bezahlen, ob es einem gefallen habe, wurde nicht gefragt, und das habe ich bei einem Hotelaufenthalt noch nie erlebt. Das Preis-Leistungsverhltnis war nicht in Ordnung!
__label__very_positive	It was just what we needed for our one night stay in Dahlonega. Everything was clean and the desk clerks spoke to us every time we came through.
__label__very_negative	Great Food, but Closed
__label__very_positive	It was the luck of the draw that I picked the Monaco in downtown Alexandria. DC has always been a difficult, if not frightening experience for me. Then along came Kimpton's Hotel Monaco Alexandria. Our room was a single king. It came with a large flat panel TV, pre-filled goody shelf and fridge, Free WiFi, nice lounge and plenty of room. The decorating was tasteful, well done, and quite comfortable. The most exceptional part of the hotel, however, was the staff. It was obvious that they had been well trained from house keeping to management. All were polite, helpful and made us feel welcome and at home. The location is incredible. It is located on King St about 4 blocks up from the river and one more block from the Ferry stop. King St is the main artery that runs through the heart of old town Alexandria. The setting is beautiful and relatively quiet. There are shops and restaurants up and down both sides of the street for blocks. History abounds here so there is plenty to do just in the local area without going into DC. If you want to do the DC thing, there is a free trolley which runs every 15 min from 10am to 10pm the length of King St (20 blocks) to drop you off at the Metro station. You can pick up the blue line there which will take you to about any site you want to see or get to including National Airport. Old Alexandria is a very comfortable place to be. I felt at ease walking along King St any time of the day or night.

In ShortSince the Ramada brand made its debut in 1954 in Flagstaff, Ariz., the hotel franchise has been offering dependable accommodations with budget-wise perks. Families appreciate the kids-stay-free policy for children 17 and under staying with their parents. Other amenities usually include a swimming pool, full-service restaurant, lounge, in-room data ports and voice mail. Group rates--for wedding parties, corporate groups or family reunions--are available for parties requiring 10 or more rooms per night.

We payed for 3 people but they said they would only provide breakfast for 2. I had an unpleasant haggle with the management to finally work this out
__label__very_positive	Clean and comfortable room. Great breakfast buffet, there were choices. No problem with wi-fi. The A/C worked great. The mini fridge however didn't work and had a funky smell. Although there weren't many restaurant options near the hotel, it was close to the Talking Stick Resort Arena.

__label__positive	Crazy lady at the desk would not give me a receipt - she said I had to get if from hotel. Com. And the guest computer / business's center had such a strong fire wall I could not open my flash drive to open my documents and micro soft office. The man in the hot tub followed me into the locker room and made an offer to give me free whatever - that's not the hotels fault just kinda crazy . Not a bad place.

__label__very_negative	The place is run down. Rooms are dark, very poor lighting. Most of the place is closed or boarded off. Buildings that are part of the place are closed off. New owners have not upgraded since purchase and don't know when it will be upgraded, statement made by employee. What was known as the Outlaw Inn and Convention Center, and what used to be the place to go, good bands, dancing, great food, beautiful bronzes (Ace Powell, etc) for purchase is no longer. Having lived in Kalispell years ago, and having good memories of the place, I scheduled it via on-line. What a disappointment! It is now the laugh of the town. One night there was more than enough.

__label__very_negative	Was highly disappointed. Paid extra for the jacuzzi tub. The tub was a tub/shower combo in the room. The curtain rod was held up in the middle by bailing wire. The entire room would turn into a sauna with the shower or tub on. The bathroom was just a sink and toilet. It was so small that you had enough room to turn around with the door closed. We could hear every conversation from the room next to ours. We could hear the upstairs people walking to the bathroom. We could hear the vacuum running across the floor upstairs very loudly. That was such a nice thing to wake up to. We could hear the road noise from the cars on the street. There was nothing comforting about the room, and sleeping through the noise was next to impossible. The one good thing I can say is that the bed itself was comfortable. Parking was cramped. Not worth the 500 it cost for two days. Feeling like I was ripped off.

__label__very_positive	I arrived 3 hours earlier than check-in and was grateful for the courteous staff who arranged for my room to be ready right away! The rooms were spacious with large beds and comfortable, luxurious bedding. Large bathroom too. The free breakfast had a waffle-maker with batter, toaster-oven for bagels, etc., and various cereals, coffee, and juice. The hotel is in Marina, about a ten minute drive to Monterey hotspots. I enjoyed my stay and appreciated the hospitality.
__label__neutral	The hotel room with king bed was roomy, quiet, and comfortable. It had a sofa and old fashioned tube TV. No connections on the TV for external media. Room had a mini fridge and microwave. Hotel had warm cookies in the lobby and breakfast available by 5:00 which is helpful for early morning sportsmen. Location was close enough to Astoria and sat along the river with a trail in the back to a park. Just a few things to improve on...1) One of my towels in the room had blood on it upon arrival. Yech! 2) The freezer door on the mini fridge was broken. 3) The toiletries were fine except for the lotion which poured out as fast as water and didn't smell good. Decent comparative value.

__label__very_positive	Venice is beautiful! Westin is on the water, which is amazing. We had an incredible room overlooking the church across the way and saw the Canal activity all day long. Water taxi stand and restaurant on water right at the hotel. It is also near the inlet/outlet of the Grand Canal, which gives easy access to Saint Marco square where public water busses have stops and launch to Murano and Burano. This is distinctly different than being at a hotel in the middle of Venice, or midway along the Grand Canal. No right or wrong, but important to be aware of, in case it matters.

__label__very_positive	The inside chairs were uncomfortable. I would of like to see a couch to sit on but with the bed in the room there was simply no room for one. It was a nice room and had everything you needed. Kitchen was well stocked. The view was beautiful. It was right on the ocean. The morning breakfast they offered was great. The staff was friendly and helpful.
__label__very_positive	Nice clean room, friendly staff, good breakfast options.
__label__neutral	The hotel wasn't great and it wasn't bad.........It was good. The facility is outdated and the pool had enough chlorine to whiten your whites. The room was spacious and the breakfast filled you up. We are travelling with our dog and he was comfortable in the room with us. I would have liked to have seen a dog station outside a few irresponsible pet owners left dog feces on the property, shame on them....... If I had to ask one thing of Best Western, please replace the mattresses or box springs every time our kids moved at night or my wife and I shifted the coils and springs were LOUD!!!!!! I would stay here again if passing through but not fr more then a night.

__label__very_positive	This Hotel was built sideways to avoid facing the busy highway. When I checked in, I was assigned the room facing the highway on the side of the building. I asked for another room and the Clerk not only graciously changed my room, she gave me a bigger room for the same price. I was impressed with the outstanding customer service. The breakfast is better than what is offered in most hotels. I found the bacon wasn't cooked enough and asked if they could make some crispier for the following morning. When the Clerk saw me arrive to breakfast, he immediately had the Kitchen staff make crispy bacon for me. I can't say enough about the staff and how accommodating they are. Tuesday through Thursday, they offer Happy Hour from 5:30 to 7:30PM. Great variety of cold beers as well as wine. The appetizers were different each night. This Comfort Inn is expanding by doubling their size and making suites. The addition is supposed to be ready by July. I never heard the construction from my room. I already booked this same Hotel the next time I am in Edinburg for business. Tons of nearby restaurants and shops. They offer 4 pillows for each bed. Two pillows are firm and two are soft. Love this Comfort Inn. They know how to distinguish themselves.
__label__very_positive	As always great!
__label__positive	Very nice resort. The outdoor pool area was more worn than the pictures represent, and the kid's pool was crowded. Overall, very nice. Our room was pretty clean, but the sliding door to the outside needed a good cleaning. Newly remodeled shower had great water pressure. The location of the resort was amazing and in a very affluent area. The front desk person tried charging me 25 for a 16 t-shirt, so be careful of this. Stay away from the pantry area for snacks as they are ridiculously expensive.

__label__positive	This hotel was nice and a great value for the money. The free breakfast in the morning was basic but I loved the waffles. The staff was friendly and the location was clean.

__label__very_positive	Nice hotel close to attractions and train stations
__label__positive	A Surprise
__label__neutral	The first room I was given had not been cleaned from the previous guest but the front desk staff got me in to another room. The room was ok beds were a little hard and the pillows had needed to be changed out because they were so old and lumpy.the television in the room was at least 10 years old and did not have any access to the movie channels advertised do to it not being able to view HD channels. The free WIFI was great multiple access points and was very fast with no problems streaming video.

There is breakfast in the morning for free. We would definitely stay here again. The only thing that sucked was the parking space is a little tight and there is no AC. At night it was fresh because we open up the windows to let the cold air in. They also have a fire place! Overall it was a good stay!

__label__very_positive	Great hotel, friendly, helpful staff and wonderful breakfasts. We have stayed at this location several times for family events and have always been happy.
__label__neutral	The hotel was in a great location, with great views of the ocean and sunset. The condo was in ok shape, not quite the condo I was expecting when I booked this trip. The faucet in the bathtub had a constant leak 100 of the time with hot water. It almost seemed that every time we went to the office they were closed or out (even when the sign said open 8-5). However these were minor issues that did not deter from our vacation very much.

The room was filthy, the towels were stained, there was an attached bar/ night club which added to the late night noise levels. Many tractor trailer rigs were parked out back outside my room, and some idled their engines all night long. Thie room was way overpriced. The staff were very friendly though.
__label__positive	Clean, and quiet hotel
__label__very_negative	Not the first time I've stayed here. Probably our 5/6th time. Three rooms to get it right. First one didn't lock second didn't have a working tv. Washer stained my clothes bc it clearly didn't rinse or spin properly and dryer ate my money. Didn't complain about washer bc hey it happens but dryer ate my 8 quarters and hotel staff did not believe me.

Room was very new and clean, the king size bed was extremely comfy, flatscreen tv, great bathroom, and clean soothing jacuzzi tub. Timing was not the best as it was a family oriented weekend so children were running up and down hallways incessantly from 8am till around 11pm but we brought ear plugs thank god. When your neighbor turns their jacuzzi on it sounds like a freight train and they were using their jacuzzi till 1am which was just ridiculous they were probably sleeping in there yet again thank god for good ear plugs and the plush mattress we still managed to sleep great! The continental breakfast was okay, the belgian waffle makers were pretty good and a decent selection of baked goods and cereal. Overall a great value just learn from me and don't go during the New Years weekend.

__label__positive	We only needed a place to spend the night. It was a fine no-frills hotel. But there is a refrigerator in the room which is nice. The heat AC worked. Bathroom was clean. Room was ok, too. The breakfast was room temperature, but it did have sausage patties, biscuits and gravy, waffles and coffee. And there is a microwave available. There was no half and half, only creamers and 2 milk. We will probably stay again, but will buy half and half for coffee and go to Ponderosa next door for breakfast. There is a Ponderosa, KFC and Taco Bell that shares the parking area with the Ramada.

__label__negative	Valet service was unorganized upon our arrival - I had to go find them and then my husband had to drive around the block until they could accommodate us- our room was not ready (even at 5pm when we arrived) - they took our phone number to call us when it was ready and then never called - we called back at 7:30pm. - On one of our days our room was never serviced - took 45 minutes to have someone come and give us clean towels - staff was curt when I called them-- had to extend our stay one night due to weather - was told it was all set when I called from DC but when we got back to the hotel the desk was unaware that we were staying another night - lots of confusion about us having to move to another room or not move as they were doing renovations on our floor. Just very unorganized.

__label__positive	Hotel is old and is in good condition. Rooms small as was bathroom in lower room. No room for a chair in most rooms if small. Comfortable beds and all new furnishings and bathroom updates, good AC is a must as hot hot hot in summer months. Reception desk on second floor and not handicap accessible if not with folks who can climb the stairs. Day staff helpful with dining in or delivery. taxi service so prompt after called. A room refrigerator would be nice as no continenental breakfast. Most hotels, even small boutique ones offer more than hot beverages and a fruit bowl. toast and bagels or doughnuts with juice or milk would have been an added treat to staying in such a historic home full of nola charm and history. Neighborhood treasure is Frenchmen St (as Bourbon St for the young) and we older folks just want good food and fine jazz. Have to taxi it or walk in heat to catch bus tours as no hotel pick up for just the 2 of us. Staff did book two tours for us and they were fantastic, city/cemetrary and plantation. History is everywhere and so much fun to hear and see all around the area.

__label__very_negative	Well, we arrived at the hotel around 10pm, after a long drive and had to wait in line for about 30 min to check in. Some how they only had one person to check every one. For the price we paid, I was expecting a better experience... The only reason I booked that room was because it had a tub/shower however, the tub was dirty, I could not even used it( We had no tv remote control in the room and the hallway stank badly!! The casino was nice, but no one came up to offer us a drink. The restaurant was ok, the food was marginal. The best part was walking around the neighborhood, it is a great location!! We walked back to our room around 2 am and the check in line was still going strong... Checking out next morning was a nightmare, people complaining of various situations and still having to wait in line for awhile, this time at least they had 2 people at the front desk! They never asked how our stay was, and when I mentioned we had no tv remote in the room the guy said oh well, maybe the last guest just took it I don't like to complain and understand sometimes things happens, but come on... One more think, the parking lot is a bit far and if you are planning to bring a lot of things from your car it sUcks!!! I don't think I will ever satay there again!

The staff is outstanding friendly and helpful. They immediately make you feel welcome and it never stops throughout your stay. The rooms are beautiful and comfortable - very relaxing. We can't think of a better place to celebrate any event, but in particular a wedding or anniversary. It is romantic and classy and just the best place we have ever stayed. We can't say enough great things about it!
__label__very_positive	Best of the best!
__label__very_positive	We had a great time. The hot springs pools were delightful. Everything was very clean and comfortable.Towels were available in the pool and hot springs areas. I would highly recommend staying in this lodge.
__label__very_positive	Could use an update on a few things... Noticed mold in shower and such but overall good experience!
__label__very_negative	Needs updates and cleaned
__label__very_positive	The bed and the sofa could have been more comfortable and I wished there were some small foldable chairs for the balcony but otherwise a wonderful apartment (very spacious, gorgeous bathroom). What's really fabulous about this hotel is the service - absolutely superb! Great staff, wonderful food, good wine! And who wouldn't be won over by being greeted with Prosecco!!!
__label__positive	Decent hotel for money, good value

__label__very_positive	i brought my dog to the hotel and on the website for expedia it says pets accepted but there never said there was a fee. they let my dog stay for free. they were really nice there.
__label__neutral	We recently spent the weekend at the SF Mandarin Oriental. While the view and room were very nice the room service, food, and overall experience was not on par with other 5 star locations like the Ritz Carlton or St. Regis. If there were a rating for room service food I would have to give it a 1 star. I've had better food at low end hotels. The front desk staff was cordial but cold. We actually had to dig at them to ... view moreget details on the package we purchased for our stay. If all you're looking for is view and quiet, this is your place. If however you want the total 5 star experience you're better off going to the Ritz Carlton in SF or Half Moon Bay.
__label__positive	Nice hotel close to air show.
__label__positive	For some reason I ended up with a handicapped room (assigned by Expedia) which I did not really need but it served the purpose. Did not spend much time in the room but I was satisfied with the room and the service.
__label__very_positive	Stay on a high floor and enjoy the view
__label__positive	We travel quite a bit and on this trip we just needed a place to sleep. The rooms are small but were fine for what we wanted. They provide a modest breakfast, plenty of parking and the beds were very comfortable. The staff is very friendly and helpful, much nicer than many places we've stayed. We will stay again when in the area.
__label__neutral	A good place to stay if you don't mind going down the hall for a bathroom. Definitely a 'student housing/hostel' type place but it's in a great neighborhood easy to get to from Back Bay T. Rooms very basic no AC.
__label__very_positive	We have been to this area several times to watch our son play his college football games. This hotel has been the cleanest by far. Staff was very nice. The homemaking staff was so kind and asked if we needed anything. We will be staying at this hotel from here on out.
__label__very_positive	Everything we experienced at this resort was top notch from the food, the staff, to the hotel itself. There was no waiting at the restaurants (no reservations required) and they were extremely accommodating to our every request. We are already planning our trip back for next year. Best vacation ever!
__label__very_positive	Great price!
__label__neutral	Stayed at the Dor-Shada for business reasons two times this year. Neither time was very notable. Hotel is rather removed from other places. Room is clean and bed is comfortable but there are not any nice touches to the room. Breakfast buffet is mediocre. Not much choice and no omelete station. Pastries are horrible. Beach is so so. Nice pool... More

__label__positive	The hotel was perfect for our needs. My only complaints: 1) The A/C unit rattled off and on all night. Our friends in another room had the same complaint. This really should be fixed in EVERY room, since a good night's sleep is the most important thing when staying in a hotel. 2) The hot breakfast was mediocre. The eggs didn't look very appetizing and it was hard to distinguish between the gravy and the oatmeal.
__label__neutral	I was very pleased with the location of the hotel as well as the outside accommodations (pool, beach access), etc. The actual room was nice and clean as well, however I was very disappointed that there was no mirror outside of the bathroom sink area. Being that it was my birthday trip and I was getting dressed to go out every night, I hated not being able to see myself in a full-length mirror before I went out to hit the town. I was also disappointed that the bar closed at 8 p.m. so if you're looking for a party hotel, this is not the one for you! But you can walk to some others down the strip.

Our suite was spotless and had plenty of room for us to sleep comfortably. The owner greeted us upon arrival and gave us helpful pointers about places to eat (49th State Brewing Co) and driving to Denali (road... More
__label__positive	This place sufficed for an overnight stay. The room itself was clean overall, however, the cushions on the sofa sleeper were torn falling apart. Also, there was no mention of the pool area being shut down for renavations so our kids were disappointed to find they couldn't swim.

__label__neutral	Smoke Free but still smells like smoke
__label__very_positive	Great value! Near everything.
__label__neutral	Stray dogs in parking lot, not so clean rooms
__label__very_negative	Front desk staff was unprofessional with my grandson who is a minor. Questioned him about how many people were in the room and told him that they didn't show the same amount of people so they were going to charge more money. First it was inappropriate to discuss this with a minor and secondly we gave Expedia the correct number of guests.
__label__positive	Best Deal for money
__label__very_positive	Hotel beds were hard & uncomfortable.  I heard every noise our neighbors made, from coughing to flushing. Horrible night of sleep!
__label__negative	Upon entering the room, it was extremely warm. We soon discovered there was no way to control the temperature. We were told we could open the window, but there was no screen. We were also concerned that for such an old building, that the smoke detector had been taken apart.
__label__neutral	Nice hotel staff. Long lines at breakfast.
__label__very_positive	The room was a good size and the air condition was really good. No complaints. It's less than 10 minutes walk to the cathedral, so really central. Would highly recommend!
__label__neutral	For a reasonably priced hotel this one is good, clean and the breakfast is alright. We did not find the staff very friendly but the breakfast service was good. We would stay here again because our family is close by but we may try another chain next time.

__label__neutral	We chose this hotel for the size of its rooms and value. For a family of five the two bedroom suite was very comfortable. Unfortunately we were disappointed by uncleanliness and lack of housekeeping. Our room had garbage in it, urine in the toilet, and dirty towels when we got there. We also asked for housekeeping but in the two nights we were there no one ever came in to our room. Disappointing!
__label__very_positive	Great place to stay at a reasonable price.

__label__very_negative	Editorial Review by Citysearch Editors Moderately-priced accommodations feature in-room coffeemakers, cable TV and hair dryers. Free local and long-distance calls, weekday newspapers and breakfast also provided.
__label__very_positive	This place was just what we hoped for. Telluride was pretty amazing too! Staff was friendly, accommodations were great to recharge. We will be back! Food was great too!
__label__very_positive	The hotel was nice and clean. The people were very friendly. We will be back.
__label__very_positive	The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel was nice and clean. It had a nice old time feel perfectly mixed with modern amenities.

__label__very_positive	Nice surprise with this one.
__label__positive	Typical
__label__positive	My wife and I booked this location at the last minute, and we were mostly pleased with our stay. They were clean, accommodating, and a helpful staff. We found the biggest drawback was the stiff mattress and thin pillows, but overall a good value for the money. There is also a 100 deposit when you check in, so be prepared for that charge.
__label__very_positive	Convenient and Wonderful Stay
__label__negative	Good location, right on the highway. Moderately loud truck noises in the morning but tolerable.
__label__neutral	The rooms were pretty clean, the beds didn't look inviting but were comfortable, and the pool was nice. The breakfast was OK. The entire hotel could use some maintenance/upkeep. The room I was in faces a busy street so there was some traffic noise, and there may be safety/security concerns for some guests. The room door opens to the outside, and there's about a 2-3 minute walk through the parking lot (no paved footpath) to go to the office or the pool from the room. The staff wasn't that friendly I'd guess they get customers trying to push the rules frequently. They wear ribbons and get stars if customers write a good review, but the scheme seems a bit forced. Overall, the hotel was decent, but I wish I'd paid another 20 to stay in a nicer hotel.
__label__positive	We stayed here overnight October 2015 for a wedding in Sedalia. It was very clean and nicely decorated, and the staff was nice.

__label__very_negative	I would never stay here again!
__label__positive	I stay in hotels in the area every week for my job. I usually stay in Burlingame but could not find a decent priced room so I thought I'd give Hotel Aura a try after reading the reviews. When I walked in, I was immediately greeted by the front desk clerk who checked in me in quickly. When I entered my room on the third floor, it smelled nice and was very spacious. What I was most impressed with was how clean it was. I did't find anything that wasn't clean! I only had two issues with the room. The bed was rock hard my back was killing me the next day. Also, the walls are thin. My neighbor kept me up until 1am but to be fair, I don't sleep well in hotels. I would recommend this hotel it you want a well appointed, clean room. I already have a room reserved for next week.

__label__negative	the good news is that the hotel is clean, safe and the internet works. The staff are pleasant. But it is very expensive for what is a very basic hotel and the food is not great. stay here if you have no alternative and just need a bed. next time I'll avoid it.

__label__neutral	I booked this hotel as I just needed a bed to sleep in for one night during a conference. For the price I paid, I expected the room to be sub-par. The check in was fast and I was directed to a room that was described as facing the WalMart parking lot. My first thought was this night won't go well. The room was pleasantly clean and surprisingly very quiet. I had an excellent night's sleep and did not hear a peep. There was a hot breakfast however I did not utilize it as my conference provided food. All in all, I would say that this hotel did its job!

__label__very_positive	We have stayed all over the world and have to say this was one of the best hotel experiences we can recall. The location is amazing, the staff is beyond wonderful and the room was out of this world. we had side canal suite with 4 massive marble columns in it made for a very elegant presentation. The bathroom was huge with a tub for two. Breakfast at 30 euros was actually a value based on the attention and quality of food. The Met was a good formal dinner option but expensive 300 euro for two with just a few glasses of wine. The staff is super helpful and friendly and made good suggestions for activities. Could easily make this a regular stop
__label__positive	THIS IS OUR SECOND VISIT AND WOULD RETURN, WE DID NOTICE IN PLACES THAT SOME OF THE FURNITURE HAD HOLES IN THE ARMS OF SOFA 'S AND NOW BECOMING DATED IN SOME AREAS. SOME OF THE STAFF WERE VERY HELPFUL AND COULD NOT DO ENOUGH TO PLEASE, OTHERS COULD BE OFF HAND AN INEXPERIENCED. ON OUR FIRST DAY AT BREAKFAST WE COLLECTED OUR CEREALS , FRUIT AND JUICES,AND BREAD, LEFT THE TABLE TO COLLECT OUR EGGS, WHEN WE RETURNED EVERTHING WAS GONE, NOTHING WAS LEFT THEY BROUGHT US SOME MORE CUTLERY , WE HAD TO EAT THE EGGS AS THEY WOULD OF BEEN COLD, THEN RETURN TO COLLECT EVERYTHING AGAIN, NO APOLOGIE FROM STAFF THAT COULD SEE WE WERE DISAPPOINTED. THE FOLLOWING MORNING ONLY ONE OF US LEFT THE TABLE AT A TIME, BUT WE NEVER RECEIVED OUR HOT DRINKS, EVEN AFTER GIVING OUR ORDER,AGAIN I THINK SOME OF THE MORNING STAFF NEED BETTER TRAINING. OTHER WISE ENJOYED OUR STAFF.

__label__positive	We were in that area for a 50k trail race. Everyone at the hotel was very friendly. A girls basketball team was also there and were racing one another down the hallway on our floor. One phone call to the front desk was all it took to alleviate the problem. The man at the front desk got us peanut butter for our race even before the advertised breakfast time.

It's an excellent choice for the price you paid.

__label__very_positive	Great stay
__label__neutral	My son and I were just passing through town on our way to PA where he attends University. As usual, I booked a non-smoking room, which was confirmed at check-in. It was clear however that the room was, at best, a 'converted' smoking room (it was room 115 if you want to know). In addition to the overall residual smell of smoke in the room, the bathroom was extremelly smelly. It was interesting to note that all the rooms but ours had a room number with a non-smoking or smoking symbol on it (hmmmm...) Room 115 was also at the beginning of the 'smoking' rooms along the hallway, and if I remember correct, the room across the hall was a smoking room. We'd already checked and the only other comperable room was a true smoking room, so we bucked up and stayed the night. I'll be avoiding this Comfort Inn on any future trips.

My friend was in the mood for lunch and ordered a crisp, thin-crust bacon cheeseburger pizza which was fabulous. I ordered off of the brunch menu and got the best pancakes I have ever had in my life. They were incredibly fluffy and served with homemade peach melba preserves and toasted walnuts. I have also had dinner at Lobby, and I can say that this restaurant is fabulous all around.

__label__negative	We showed up late and the place had a cool neon old school feel to it. But once out of the car we found a lot of rif raft around the area. They appear to have been patrons but I'm not sure if it was just the ours we were awake or what. But once in room, it was ok, older but clean. only there for about 4hrs then back on the road. Probably would not stay here again. Stayed many other places around it and all others have been better

__label__positive	The outside of the hotel looks really old, but the room itself is very nice and clean. The breakfast was excellent to eat there and on the go! Although there isn't a lot right in that area, it's a 15 min or less drive from anything you need.
__label__very_positive	Very nice room is a little outdated feeling. You can easily get great views of Times Square (thankfully minus the noise) if you're on the right side of the hotel.
__label__very_positive	It's a good place to stay. Not terribly close, but not terribly far from anything. Staff is nice, rooms are normal hotel rooms. Prices are fair. Kinda like purgatory. Could use a fridge though.
__label__positive	Comfort Inn Bend OR
__label__neutral	The lodge room was spartan with no desk or shelf area nor chair. If you wanted to watch TV you had to lay or seat on the bed. Using the coffee maker was impossible since on the sink was the only location adding risk if you were trying to get ready (teeth, etc) at the same time. There is a nook in the room which a shelf could easily be added for the coffee maker and ice bucket making room around the sink. In addition there is room for a chair in the room and would be easy to provide a lap desk (board to be placed on lap for laptop, etc). If you are going to use room as individual hotel room these should be a minimum since the main room is not available. I asked the front desk to have maintenance unlock the safe (locked shut by previous tenants) and they logged the request. Reminded them each morning and never done...on checkout the front desk did remove parking fees since this was not accomplished. In addition requested a temporary chair but never delivered. Front desk staff was great and did their job but beyond that nothing happened. Overall staff at desk, restaurant, and housekeeping were friendly and did an outstanding job. Expensive for such a poorly equipped room.

__label__very_negative	"I was traveling with my grandchildren, so I choose this hotel because it had an outdoor pool. Upon arrival, I saw the pool had no water, greatly disappointing my grandkids. Upon check-in, I waited while the woman at the desk finished her personal call. When commenting on the pool, she still didn't even look up and her response was a shrug and off-the-cuff comment, ""the pool had a leak"". Not even an apology or smile. She then asked if I wanted to go elsewhere. I replied that I had prepaid through Hotels.com and got another shrug. This was the good part of the stay. The room was large, but the bedspeads were dirty and sliding door disgusting with a makeshift drilled hole with a screw instead of a lock. The wallpaper was patched and horribly peeling in the bathroom. The bathroom was dirty as well, especially the floor. Thank goodness the stay was only overnight."

__label__very_positive	I love this Drury location! I recently stayed here because Zac Brown Band was playing a concert at the Schott. It is close to the Arena District, North Market, and Short North. Breakfast was awesome, but I loved the 5:30 kickback because it helped us save money both on dinner and drinks. They made an awesome dirty martini, and it... More
__label__positive	The fabulous view from my room the fitness center is worth the stay, the spa services were excellent, but the room seemed in need of updating. Bland vanilla decor with small beds. For the price of the room the number of stars, I've stayed at a lot better places. Plus, the pool was super tiny more than a few guests in the pool made it seem like you were crashing someone else's party. Looks like remodeling was underway, but I'd wait until it's complete to go back. Glad I only stayed 2 nights of the 5 I was in town.

__label__positive	Room was clean, attractive and well priced. Staff was friendly. My only critique is that the dining room is a little small for the size of the hotel and there is some road work that made entering the parking lot a little confusing (obviously the latter is not the hotels fault.)

__label__neutral	We had an event at MetLife stadium and chose this hotel because it was fairly close and reasonably priced. The hotel was clean and modern. Breakfast was horrible and the rooms were tiny. Not that a huge room was needed but more than a small pathway around the bed to the bathroom would have been nice. Overall I think well stay elsewhere next year.

__label__very_positive	superb all the way!
__label__very_positive	Average Holiday Inn Express
__label__very_negative	No parking. Up to you to find parking on the street. TV remote taped on back to hold batteries in and would not work for volume and on off. TV was the size of a lap top in a corner. Our room was 11 which is next to the front door so we could hear everyone coming and going each time they opened the door. Breakfast was a block away at Panera. They did not have what we wanted on the menu that the Lodge Staff had given us. The air conditioner was small and in a hole in the wall very high up. The average person would not be able to reach high enough to turn it off which we did because it was loud, so it was to be hot or not be able to sleep for the noise. The bathroom sink was barely big enough to wash your hands. Poor security, only a chain lock on back door.

__label__very_positive	Had a great time, really enjoyed the lake and the pool. My bathroom was not clean the first night we were there. I mentioned it on my way checking out....but no one seemed that concerned. However the grounds were worth giving this hotel a try. The hotel is a little older but you really don't see it that much. It's just that the bathroom in my room was really really small. It was hard to get out of the shower without hitting the toilet...ask for a room with a larger bathroom. My other family members had one that was larger. I give the hotel high marks for it's location, grounds, pool and access to the lake with beautiful views from the balcony.

We will be back!

__label__very_negative	After booking the room a few days prior snd calling a few hours before we arrived to confirm, the hotel did not have the room I requested and only had one king bed available. We had traveled 13 hours and had no room! The front desk associate was able to locate a room at a different establishment. My family had to sleep at a filthy roach motel. I will not book at La Quinta ever again.

__label__positive	I am the disabled victim of a drunk driver. For 5 years now, I have been on very heavy doses of narcotic pain medication, and will be for life. It is very dangerous living alone, and I won't tolerate another human living with me. So, I have a specially trained dog trained as an alert dog to watch me and make my life safe to live. Last month, we (my dog, Dana and I) went to Ft Lauderdale, and we stayed at the Ocean breeze motel. We had a wonderful stay. The motel doesn't allow regular pets, which is one of the reasons we chose it. Less to possibly distract Dana. Beyond that, the rates were low enough for a lower income (the drunk was uninsured) disabled man and his K9 assistant. The owners treated us wonderfully, as they treat their property. What a great place to spend a week in paradise. After the grueling Chicago winter we have suffered (08-09), this motel felt like our home away from home, and we would definitely choose them if we ever would go to Ft Lauderdale again. br Shaun Adams and Dana the Doberman service dog br Chicago, Il

__label__neutral	The gentleman at the front desk was very helpful. He helped three of us with early flights snag a bit of breakfast at 4 a.m. from the kitchen area. A nice perk. Otherwise quite ok for a night's sleep. My west facing room did not have curtains to block the sun. Next time I'll get an easy facing room if I need to get to sleep early.

The desk clerk was tremendously helpful, carrying my suitcase up to my room since there's no elevator. Some of the fixtures show wear, but the room was quite comfortable, once I turned on the window AC unit. There's a nearby 24-hr pharmacy and grocery store, so I was able to get things I needed easily. Key Arena is right across the street, and the Space Needle is a relatively easy walking distance (though uphill). I'd love to stay here again when my back is healthy!

Was able to sleep in a little bit and still be able to enjoy breakfast before hitting the famous Branson strip. Had some very minor issues but management handled it in a very accommodating manner so no need to make a mad review. All in all I can't wait to go back and will definitely see if Dockers Inn has any vacancies.

__label__positive	This hotel had the basic qualities that I would expect from a 2.5/3.0 facility.It was a little crowded the weekend we were there due to some soccer teams in town. I would say, many 12-15 yr. old boys. The pool was very crowded as was the fitness room and breakfast room in the morning. I also feel that for the price, a room with 2 Q beds, for 4 people, should be a little larger and include more seating options.....and, should have 2 part bathroom with 2 sinks.

I liked that the room was very clean and I had a good view of the ocean. The deck had two lounging chairs for relaxation. The price was reasonable. The bed was very comfortable. Easy access to the beach from the hotel.

__label__very_positive	Worst night ever Following an illness on a business trip, I ended up finding a room at the Hudson. If I had wanted to have a drink and socialize, the atmosphere would have been perfect, but for a person not feeling well and needing to rest, this was nearly impossible. First of all, the mattress felt like sleeping on a box spring. Hard, uncomfortable, with coils very noticeable. Second, the tv service wasn't getting great reception, so everything I wanted to watch was out. Third, the light near the bed was broken and could not be turned off. Fourth, being on the 5th floor was as loud as being on the street. The location is fantastic for partying, but not for sleep. Sirens, car horns, hell, trucks parking, they all sounded 20 feet away. I thought the decor was fantastic, but would prefer a decent mattress to fancy mirrors and lighting.

__label__positive	Our room was clean and the staff were friendly and helpful.
__label__neutral	OK but lobby was small with few tables to have continental breakfast;  unusual layout with parking lot in the back of the building.
__label__very_positive	Awesome brunch at a great price
__label__very_positive	Motel 72 is a very clean, friendly, reasonably priced motel. It was the location we needed and just off the beaten path for a quiet, but convenient stay. It's refreshing to give money to individuals as opposed to a chain. The slightly miss matched decore may bother a few. However, the level of cleanliness more than made up for it.
__label__very_negative	Wouldn't stay again.
__label__very_positive	Great decent hotel

__label__very_positive	Great place to stay. The rooms are big, clean and comfortable. I was able to get the 99 rate and was given a room on the 16th floor, so my judgement is a little skewed. My room was fabulous! Giant shower, tub, fireplace huge balcony!
__label__very_positive	Excellent hotel would go back!
__label__neutral	Great location for seeing the city.

__label__negative	"Not a great experience at ""quality"" Inn long beach"
__label__negative	Do not stay here!!
__label__positive	Great hotel in great location but expensive rooms and parking. Could have stayed a few blocks west on King street for $100 less a night had I known that bus service on King street is free and frequent. The two beds in our room where very narrow for two and who wants to sleep in separate beds?

__label__neutral	Okay, could have been better
__label__positive	Within walking distance (15 min) to Universal Studios, surrounded by places to eat including a really great Mexican restaurant at the end of a strip mall across the street. A corner store,Starbucks, 7- Eleven, Fast food, buffet, bar and CVS are close by. Hotel is on the Green Trolley path (G2) and on the bus route so it was VERY convenient to get to Sea World and Aquatica instead of renting a car. The pool was clean ( but warm). Building was secure with key cards at all entries. Hotel room was clean. Families stayed there and it was pretty quiet. It is no frills so don't expect the fancy toilet paper and pancakes for breakfast ( unless you make them), but you can save money for your family by cooking pizza in the stove or pasta on the range, use the microwave, fridge ( w/Ice tray) and the dishwasher. The manager was very hospitable and friendly and we liked her a lot. There were a few things wrong with our room and she did her best to make the situation right and we appreciated it. Its the people that make the business. We'd come back.
__label__very_positive	Beautiful big rooms in a great location. Steps away from shopping and restaurants
__label__negative	Not worth it
__label__very_positive	Great suite and hospitality
__label__very_negative	NEVER AGAIN!!
__label__very_negative	Not staying here again. We arrived very late at night so made do, but were not happy with our stay. The linens on one of the beds were used and dirty, had not been replaced. There were lots of maintenance issues in the room, holes in the walls, missing fiextures etc. The staff was rude, the desk clerk was very short, and discurteous at checkout, and a member of the cleaning staff was extreamly rude. As we were leaving our room, she cut my wife and son off, telling them to, and i quote, move. The breakfast was horrible as well. Theye were out of several things, the waffless they prepared for the guests were overcooked, and the milk was either old, tainted, or there was something altering the taste in the dispense, it was inedible. We will never stay here again.
__label__very_positive	Was perfectly located for our purposes. 10 minutes from my friend's home. A little noisy since located next to a major highway, but felt safe. Desk personnel suggested we park on the south side of the building so our car would start better. Temps were near or at 0 degrees! Very friendly and helpful staff. Very good value!
__label__very_positive	Great hotel

__label__very_positive	Greatly enjoyed my overnight stay. Was excellent for fitting my business needs.
__label__very_positive	Perfect location
__label__very_positive	If you have a car it's worth staying here. We had a great suite for a very reasonable price. It doesn't include breakfast as it's like a cabin. We even saw a moose with twin calfs from our window. The owners are very nice and accomodating people. Just know the drive to Denali park is about 30 minutes.

__label__negative	Not bad for low budget hotel near I95. 1st room had a moldy/musty odor. Night desk clerk happily changed it to the room next door, which wasn't as musty. Decor is old and carpeting, curtains, and bed-spread should be updated to give a cleaner look/feel. The in-room safe was locked so you can't use it(that's why they didn't charge the 5/night fee). There's also some meeting/convention rooms that are used by church and tour groups. Fortunately groups eat in a separate breakfast area. Breakfast was very basic. Inside is a car rental shop. The business center is in the hallway. Front desk provided cookies at night and coffee/water in the hallway. The non-front doors weren't secured by room key access alone, rather they were open to anyone who wanted to wander in. The room door was not neatly lined up with the door jamb, but the lock worked. There were also a lot of student groups staying to visit DC- they were loud and noisy at night but eventually went to sleep. There is ample parking. They share a shuttle van to Springfield Franconia Metro station with the Wyndham next door, which may have been a bit nicer hotel. I probably won't stay there again. But not bad if just passing through a need a bed to crash on- which was comfortable. But the room looked old and dirty.

__label__very_positive	Excellent and reasonably - priced place (compared to other places in the region) in a very convenient location. Perfect spot to explore both Napa and Sonoma. Lodge was clean, king size bed very comfortable, and overall spacious enough for this type of room. Breakfast was quite good, with a gourmet coffee machine with many choices, yogurt, fruit, cereal, bagels, bread, spreads, and egg/ham croissants. Thank you to Judy who was very helpful and gave me great info on how to explore Sonoma County and even to Bodega Bay. We did what she recommended, and had an awesome day! She also recommended 3 different places for dinner, all of which were excellent. Overall, highly satisfied with Wine Valley Lodge and will definitely stay here again!

__label__negative	"has me seriously re-thinking if I will ever use Expedia again!!  Hotel was dingy, worn down, strange smell as soon as you walked in.  The room was so dim and when we went to turn the lights on, nothing worked.  We were able to find a maintenance man and he came in, then had to leave to find an extension cord to plug in the light!!!  Only one outlet in the room!!!!  Beds should have been replaced years ago, they were so uncomfortable and the mattresses sagged so you were sleeping in a hole!  Tub was from the 70's and the years have not been kind to it!!  Even the new shower curtain could not disguise what was going on in there!!  Honestly, we should have driven home, but decided to stay the night since it was late and there we no other hotel rooms available in the area do to Parent's weekend at the local colleges and a big rival football game.  The ""Continental Breakfast"" was a joke, and by this time, we just laughed and got the hell out of there!!!  Like I said, if this is what to expect from Expedia, I will never use them again, and I most certainly will never stay at the Howard Johnson Hotel again...."

__label__very_positive	My saty at IP... which started by the greeting of the valet attendant and as I walked into the door to check-in. Although my total experience, ranging from staff on the casino floor recognizing I had a lost look and asking if they could help to staff in the restaurants was excellent, one stood out - Ihave an inner-ear health issue that riding elevators can cause me to get sick or pass out, so I usually just use the stairs. At check-in, the lady at the front desk (I only know as Erin P.) had my 2nd floor room pull and ready. After I checked in, she told me finding the stairs can be difficult the first time and she took me to the stairs and made sure I found the correct door. I can assure you base on my experience from check-in services across the nation this was beyond the call of duty as most would see.

__label__negative	This has to be the best place to stay in Paris - walking distance to the Eiffel tower, nearby shopping, and Champs de Elysees. The hotel itself is a contemporary art deco hotel. Small lobby and no actual front check in desk - I was taken back a bit - the service is individualized and personal - the staff are all very professional speak many different languages and on top of that they don't have typical set roles as in other BIG hotels - they all do everything! Best concierge service in Paris! The room itself was gorgeous - very hard to find rooms this big in Paris - King bed - big bathroom with tub - simply luxurious!
__label__positive	Non smoking room smelled so bad of cigarette smoke I couldn't sleep.
__label__neutral	Counter people great but black mold on shower curtain where it had not been pushed open to clean in several days was real turn off. Worked in food plant sanitation and know what going on. Lazy!
__label__negative	I guess you get what you pay for. The hotel is next door to an 18-wheeler truck wash. Luckily, it was not open 24 hours. The room was small but clean. There was no place at all to hang our clothes - not even a simple rod. The continental breakfast was very basic in a very small room. I recommend spending a little more money for an upgrade.

__label__neutral	Staff were unhelpful except for room cleaners who couldn't have been nicer. Rooms OK, cleaned daily. Outside areas nice, close to the beach but not really good location for walking around with small children. Breakfast very limited, muesli only on 3 of the 10 days we stayed and you are not allowed to take your own food or drink into the hotel or grounds. People were smoking in the dining room at breakfast time, and staff took no notice when complaints were made. Receipts were not given at poolside for any drinks etc. which were charged to our room so you had to keep a tally of what had been ordered. This was our 8th time in Bali, and we thought we would try somewhere different but won't do that again. On the whole, as cheap hotels go it wasn't too bad but we would not go back there again. We prefer to pay a little more and have much better facilities, friendlier staff etc.

Please stay away until the construction is completed at the end of June 2016. We were told that it would be fully completed by April 15, 2016 and we even pre-paid our reservation, so we couldn't cancel it. As of May 06, 2016 it was not fully completed.

A friendly and attentive staff, comfortable large rooms, fantastic location in the University District just a couple blocks off The Ave with all its clubs, restaurants and shops free parking, a coffee house and bar downstairs, and views of downtown and the Space Needle. A great value!
__label__very_positive	This hotel is very nice. Bonus, they have a managers reception in the afternoon. The food is not much (cheese, crackers, bread rolls and little smokies) but you do get two beers each! No wine or liquor, but they also do have soda. The room was very nice and the bed was super.

__label__neutral	Pros: Good sized room. Great location for Universal. Excellent price value. The cons: had to request kitchen items and utensils. Room service is only once a week so you would have to take your used towels to the front desk to get fresh ones.Your feedback is important. Thank you for sharing your experience. We appreciate you letting us know that our cookware policy was an inconvenience, and for that we do apologize. However, we are happy to read you enjoyed the spaciousness of your room, our convenient location near theme parks, and our affordable rates. Once more, thank you for posting your review....
__label__positive	The hotel is beautiful and new and the service was excellent. I thought the 10 charge for what is a typical breakfast buffet at holiday inn or best western was too much and was not an excellent value and I have stayed in more comfortable beds but it is a very pretty and central hotel.

__label__positive	The only problem was that the wifi didnt work in our room. It worked in the lobby.
__label__negative	I hesitated booking this hotel for my night before an early morning flight because of the reviews stating that the parking lot situation was bad. I thought, how bad can it really be Well....bad! There was literally not a single spot available in the whole lot. People were parked along red curbs, and in fire lanes....I finally parked right in front of the lobby doors just to hop out and ask where in the heck am I supposed to park I was directed to park in front of the pizza place or the Subway in the next parking lot over, as they also own that property. I did find that there were two available spots there. So if I had been even ten minutes later, even this might not have been an option. However, even though I now had a parking spot, I then had to walk over to the hotel, and it was late at night, and I was a female, alone, walking in a neighborhood that I don't know if it was safe or not. I didn't FEEL safe. While checking in, I noticed that they offer to let people leave their cars parked there when they fly out. Which I think is a great thing....if you have the space for it! And it should be something that should be let known to guests booking as well. After the parking fiasco, I was hoping that at least the room would be nice, only to find a hotel room that, while clean, was pretty dingy. But at least the bed was comfy!!
__label__very_positive	Gathered family from around the country for wedding(5 rooms). Front desk went out of their way to make our stay nearly perfect. Large lobby area and dining room was great for us all to gather.
__label__neutral	This hotel was a switch from Motel 6 next door, as they messed up our reservation. The room was nice. Comfortable and good beds. The only negative I would state is that the carpets need cleaning badly. Every time I got in the shower I left dirty footprints, and, due to diabetic foot problems, I do not walk outside bare footed. The only place the soil could have come from was within the room.

Fr Langschlfer, man wird auch vor dem abrumen des Bfetts (11:30 Uhr) noch einmal gefragt ob man noch etwas mchte. Die Sauna hat fr uns um 21:00 Uhr geschlossen, das ist im Urlaub doch etwas frh.

__label__neutral	This hotel is no longer a country inn and suites. It is Solstice. When we arrived there was noone at the front desk. Had to go find. She was doing something at the pool. The pool water was chilly and was not open in the a m per posted hours. The breakfast was so so at best unless you like sausage gravy and biscuits. No butter. No cream for coffee. Hopefully this is just attributable to change in ownership. The beds were good though the room was okay and the staff tried. They were just understaffed.

__label__very_positive	We had a lovely time, the lodge was quaint, the staff very helpful and friendly, the room neat and clean. There was too much outside light at night and it was somewhat noisy. The breakfast was pleasant and we enjoyed being close enough to walk to the beach and to town. We would definitely like to come again.
__label__very_positive	Beautiful grounds, well maintained resort, very friendly staff. Food was good for an all inclusive resort. Room was very large size with a beautiful ocean view. Sunset Beach is a large size resort over a cliff which requires walking long distances or golf card type of transportation. We like to walk so we loved it. The only downside of the resort is that you can't swim in the ocean but they shuttle you to their sister resorts for swimming. Excellent experience. I will recommended it to my friends.
__label__neutral	Right off the highway

On main road, so need to be careful crossing, but decent chain Mexican restaurant across the street. Hotel should have take away menus in the rooms as they did deliver and that would have been easier if without a car
__label__positive	Great hotel, room was great, location also great, however, I was disappointed there was not a continental breakfast. The price being charged for breakfast was way too high too! The price you pay for a room and the reputation of this hotel I would think that breakfast would be included. It is at most other hotels.

__label__very_negative	Please consider another place for your stay. The management recommended that my companion and I go to the room first to check if any of the lights were out and to make sure the room is properly furnished before we pay for the room because there is a no refund policy. The first room we went in to check had no lights in the living room, the hair dryer was previous stolen, and the room smells like smoke. This hotel is horrible. The furniture, whatever is left of it is broken, dated, and unclean. The furniture smells, the floors will make your feet BLACK in 5 seconds. The bed is a super hard box spring with the thinnest possible bedding on top. The towels provided were so thin, you'd need two to do the job of one.

__label__neutral	Although the hotel is in a great location, the room was small.....the distance from the elevator to the room was very long....the room is attractive but the bed is not comfortable and the linen and towels are not of superior quality. There were too few bell people or valets for the car...long waits ensued always. the heating/cooling unit is loud.
__label__positive	Convenient Hotel
__label__very_positive	The room was larger than expected. We had 2 queen beds plus a separate living area. We put our grandson there to give us more privacy. It was awesome.

__label__neutral	I wish I could give this place a better review, since I love Kimpton hotels, but unfortunately the Monaco did not live up to our expectations. - Snarly woman behind the counter gave us attitude when we tried to check in 45 min early. We were happy to wait and could have lived without the unpleasantness. - Took 20 minutes and two phone calls to get our luggage up to the room after we were able to get in; on top of that they misplaced a very large pregnancy pillow that was placed in the office for safe-keeping. We finally had to walk down to find and retrieve it ourselves. - Found a black hair under the comforter upon arrival. - We were out of the room for at least 7 hours during the next day and no one cleaned our room. - The TV picture flickered on almost every channel. - We asked for a cart to bring our luggage down at checkout and no one came after 20 min. Finally had to go down to get one ourselves. Downstairs, an empty cart was sitting next to several bellhops who were chatting away to one another.
__label__very_positive	Although we checked in quite late already (10 pm), the front desk guy was very nice and welcoming. An exact situation one would wish to have after a tiring, very long drive.

__label__very_positive	We loved our stay at the Simpson House Inn. From the moment we drove in the driveway, I knew this would be a special place! We arrived early as we had driven from Los Angeles, but we were welcomed with open arms by Gillian who showed us around the Inn and then upgraded us!

__label__positive	After a long night at a women's conference and having a broken down car, the beds were wonderful and so comfortable. Sleep was amazing. The ac unit was so quite, very unusual for a window unit. Love the night here.
__label__very_positive	Great place. Would definitely stay again
__label__very_negative	The lobby and hallways had no a/c. It was cooler outside, in July, than in the building. Fortunately, the room a/c did work. The rooms themselves were cramped and small, but clean for the most part. The breakfast was a good selection. We had to leave the pool on the only sunny day of our stay because the lawn guy was going to cut the grass (understandable) but he NEVER DID. No one seemed to have any ideas about things to do in the area when asked. The guest computer in the lobby hardly ever worked and when it did, you would fall asleep in the heat waiting for it to work. This was the only hotel we found with an outdoor pool in the area, but the pool was dinky and they had a broken down handicap lift chair but no diving board or slide or anything that said kids welcome. It was a miserable stay all the way around.
__label__very_negative	in all my travels it's the second worst place I have ever stayed. Hotels.com should take it OFF your list.
__label__very_negative	Terrible customer service, they failed to clean the room, When contacting the front desk about the dirty room and no towels they had a major attitude. This hotel is like trailer park trash. They should refund our money. Do not stay here.
__label__neutral	Where to start....the beds seemed extra small, sheets were small, kids unsupervised in pool, eating in pool, jumping into the pool. Continental breakfast was great, room was satisfactory, awful view from window. Overall I don't believe I will be staying here again.

__label__positive	We were only in Seattle for a couple of days and found the location of this hotel ideal for exploring the city. It's a 20 minute walk from the Space Needle area. From there we could catch the Monotail to downtown an Pike Market. This is an older hotel, but it is very comfortable and charming. The staff was very helpful and gave good advice about places to visit and eat.
__label__negative	Room filled with smoke, less than desirable
__label__negative	th e WiFi doesn't work, there isn't enough room to turn around in the bathroom, the room itself is tiny, the bed isn't even fastened down, so don't lean against the headboard, or you'll go rolling across the room. on checkin you get a lecture on how to set the air conditioner, close the curtains, don't take a long shower. there are signs in the room also saying all these things plus what not to flush.... not exactly a feeling of comfort or hospitality. towels are paper thin. and I could keep going. but it IS clean.

__label__negative	Pros: Pros: TV and AC worked well. Mostly clean. Cons: Under construction. No elevator. Had to lug my luggage up the steps. Room was smallish. Shower head leaked like crazy from the back so lacked pressure out of the head. No hangers in closet, not even one. Police car stationed in front of hotel with officer inside. Desk clerk's explanation for police presence: The police visit us from time to time. The bright message light on room phone was blinking. I called and the person said they would take care of it. Was still blinking when I left the room in the morning.
__label__neutral	"Overall this is a great hotel, in a terrific location. Very easy to find. The room was spacious and well appointed. The wireless access was easy and very fast. My only complaints were the in-room iron was in very poor shape and the bathtub / shower tap had a continuous trickle of water unless you turned the knob slightly over toward the ""on"" position, which is obviously counter-intuitive. In the spirit of full disclosure, I did not bring this up with anyone until I was checking out. I was only staying for 2 nights and only needed the iron 1 of the mornings. My other negative was - while I was toweling off after my morning shower, I noticed a long strand of dark hair hanging off my shoulder. This was a bit gross as it clearly wasn't mine - I am pretty much bald with only a bit of ""peach-fuzz"" on the sides, which is mostly grey. It clearly must have come off the towel, which makes you wonder a bit about their laundry regime. Although, it could also have come off the cleaning staff when they were replacing the towels in the room. Either way a little ""icky"" from my perspective. However, when I brought the iron and bath tap issue up with the front desk attendant at check-out he was very apologetic and ""comped"" me a night of valet parking."

__label__very_positive	fantastic stay
__label__very_positive	Great pool area on rooftop. Great stay for the price
__label__neutral	The hotel is quite old and currently undergoing major renovation. We were in 133, which was directly affected by construction involving loud drills, pulled up carpet, exposed concrete and falling and broken plaster all over our hallways. Sounds, smells and the general aura was that of a construction zone, not a 4 star hotel. We traveled from CA with our 18 month old baby for my father's funeral. At a time when we needed comfort, peace and quiet, and a little aesthetic amenity, we got loud voices, early morning drilling, entire hallways of cold open concrete with old and large cracks and broken plaster on the floor, among other debris, all in the already uncomfortable arctic tundra cold of the dead of winter in fond du Lac. My husband fell over broken plaster congealed onto the concrete hallway and broken plastic ties strewn up and down the hazardous hallway. Our baby was awoken by drilling after finally falling asleep while being sick, and I got to write my dad's eulogy to the tune of construction and hammering and loud talking right outside my door. Bottom line, if you are going to have major renovation right outside of rooms that you are booking, disclose it and be prepared to offer an accommodation better than one night at half off.
__label__very_negative	I chose the Microtel because it was a Wyndham property my previous experience with Wyndham was fabulous, but had I known that the Microtel in Burlington, NC was operating at this level of unprofessionalism I would have mad e another choice. When I arrived the front desk attendant was very unprofessional and did not want to answer any of my questions, but it was a long drive from Philadelphia so I just checked in and went to my room. To my utter disgust the room was dirty, outdated with broken light covers, the bathroom looked as if someone let some sort of liquid drip down the wall leaving stains, the bathroom fixtures were dirty and rusted, the tub was unclean, the towels were torn and tattered with holes and to top it all off the bed was so hard that I found myself sleeping in the chair and I have supporting photos to support my review. Because we traveled for bereavement our emotions were already high and after an 11hour drive all we wanted to do was rest until the funeral services that afternoon. I would not recommend this hotel to my worse enemy, I suggest not staying at the Microtel, do not get swayed by the name Wyndham.

__label__neutral	Location is good, close to train station. Staff are very nice, breakfast is better than average. The room was really dated. The beds are comfortable. The room was clean but it is hard to make really old carpet look very clean. The lighting in the room was inadequate. It was fine for a one night stay before a flight. We probably won't stay again.
__label__neutral	First--Paid about twice the normal rate to stay on Ocean Front during Neptune Festival, but bad weather caused city to cancel the Ocean Front activities and bands. Asked about a rate reduction given the basis of the higher than normal room rate was no longer scheduled and no one could do. Didn't seem fair to pay twice the rate given the circumstance. Second-- Tub/shower leaked onto floor whenever used-- tub spout was loose off tiled wall and water was leaking in behind. Third-- Booked through Booking.Com and was not eligible for Holiday Inn reward points. Location.

__label__neutral	I booked the hotel room but I was surprised to be placed in next building in an apartment. It was big but still an apartment so it was noiser than a hotel.
__label__positive	The lady at the front desk was beyond accommodating, she was as nice as could be. The room was huge and had beach character, great for vacation. It was set up for a longer stay, we only slept there but it had a full size fridge and sink in the room. The TV was in the sitting room so not like a hotel where you watch from bed (not a complaint just different) the dock is beautiful to go out on and drink your morning coffee. Super nice grills there for you to use as well.
__label__negative	Not a pleasant stay
__label__positive	I really enjoyed the location, it was so close to the main street that runs through old town Alexandria. You could walk right out of the hotel and up and down King St to many stores, restaurants, bars, and the water. There was also a fresh farmers market in the town square literally steps from the hotel. I really enjoyed all the fresh produce and baked goods for sale there. The only thing I was unhappy with at the hotel was the parking garage. It is so small and it was packed when we checked in. Once we finally found a spot we chose to not even drive our vehicle as to not have to encounter that stressful dilemma again! Another issue was that the room did not have a microwave. If one stays several nights and has left overs from a restaurant you can not re-heat anything in your room. Plus the room comes with a refrigerator but they pack it with their items they want you to purchase so that was also a hassle I just took theirs own and put mine in until I was about to leave and then restocked it with their items. Other than that I thought the hotel was nice and very conveniently located.

The restaurant staff was very nice however my shrimp and grits was GREASY and my collard greens were gritty. My breakfast room service was fine. GREAT location for stores, restaurants, walking around.

__label__very_positive	Reception in the Skyline room was perfect. Claudia Behring, catering manager, kept in touch the weeks before the wedding. She met with us to set up a table with linens and the decorations two weeks prior. We both work and she accommodated her schedule to allow for ours. When we added a table at the last minute, she didn't flinch. Consistently kind, efficient and unruffled. I didn't feel the least bit stressed because she was so confident. On the day of the weeding, one of her assistants (so sorry to forget his name). Called with suggestions to improve the room setup and enlarge the dance floor. I was busts getting ready but he was so knowledgable, I left the updates to him. I was overwhelmed by the beauty of the room and the easy flow of the crowd. I was enormously grateful for the bigger dance floor which remained full all night. The sparkle of the candles added to the sparkle of the city lights were enchanting. The service was spectacular. A waiter looked after us all night and kept a cold glass of sparkling water in my hand all night and offered to refill our plates at dinner. I felt like a Queen. Several guests, including my sins, commented that the bartender was friendly and funny. When i made a trip to the bar to thank him, he offered to get me something - could he make something special? What a nice young man!!I would recommend the Hilton team to anyone.
__label__very_positive	What a Pleasant Surprise
__label__positive	This hotel is a wonderful place to stay, provided you aren't there on a weekend where it is filled to capacity due to some festival/marathon in one of the local towns. With so many guests present, they didn't have enough bandwith for everyone to have WiFi. My wife and I never could log on to the WiFi because it always said there were too many users accessing the system. The other downside to so many guests is that there was hardly any water pressure while taking a shower. If you do end up being there on a festival/marathon weekend, you might try showering really early in the morning or really late at night if you want more than a limp trickle out of your shower head. This really is a good hotel and despite the minor inconvienences we will definitely consider returning sometime, provided it isn't around a festival or marathon weekend.
__label__very_negative	terrible place to stay
__label__very_negative	Please don't stay here. We ignored bad reviews and were lured by the proximity to the boardwalk. Now worth it. There were pubic hairs in the tub. The office reeked of incense. The party in front of us had the same number of people and the person working described the room as the Sam as ours and they paid 30 less than us. In addition to small, dark curly hairS in the tub, it didn't drain and was just scuzzy. There was a dowel in the window-not sure if it waddle security or what but it made us all uncomfortable. There are weird boxes on the walls for temperature control. Just yuck over all.

__label__positive	Nice Room - Not So Nice Restaurant
__label__positive	While visiting Venice, I wanted to save money by staying in a suburb. I was happy with my choice. Getting there is not difficult from the Mestre train station or Venice itself. Catch a 2 bus (not the limited 2 run) The bus stops almost exactly in front of the hotel, and you can see the hotel sign on the right hand side as you approach. The Garibaldi stop is maybe four stops after the Mestre train station. To go to Venice, catch the 2 bus on the opposite side of the street. Time to the P. Roma bus terminal on Venice is about 25 minutes, but then you will also have to either walk to tourist sights or catch a Vaporetto, so really you are almost an hour away from tourist sights. Note that the bus schedule varies on Sundays and holidays, and keep in mind that Italian holidays might differ from those in the US. The hotel desk is extremely helpful, and also can sell you bus tickets and transit passes including the Vaporetto. Their English was very good. The neighborhood is very generic, but the street was quiet pleasant with brick sidewalks and trees lining the street. There are two small markets and a laundromat close by. My stay included breakfast which was a nicely done. The room, like most in Europe was small also the shower was a curtained off segment of the bathroom not sumptuous but adequate. The hotel overall is utilitarian, not a romantic venue. But, I would not hesitate to stay there again.
__label__very_positive	Exceptional hotel

__label__very_positive	Going into the hallway from outside, there was a notice on the door that the hotel would be doing some renovations in the coming months. I assumed this meant that our room was going to be run down and in need of updating, but we were both pleasantly surprised when we opened the door to our room and found a very nice mini-suite. Would definitely stay here again. They are also dog friendly. :)
__label__positive	Food was meh'... Everything else was great. Not a hotel for people who might have issues getting around.

Crack between door jamb big enough for ANY bug/rodent to come in. HVAC unit created a urine-like smell in the room. Bedside phone did not work.

__label__positive	The thing that separates this hotel from others,as is usually the case, is the staff. Briefly, Miss Secret (her true name) is awesome. Not only was she very helpful in providing directions and tips about restaurants. she even filled us in on the least expensive/closest places to park for what we wanted to see in Memphis. She should be commended on her spectacular customer service.
__label__negative	The night clerk was most unhelpful getting us to sign on to wifi. Only the coffee maker frame was there. Bathroom was in C grade condition.
__label__neutral	Nice place, but not outstanding
__label__very_positive	Very nice interior. Very modern room. The neighborhood is in a industrial area. There is a bus you can take directly into NYC aND about a 20 minute walk to light rail station. Overall nice stay and the staff was very friendly and helpful.
__label__positive	We arrived at the hotel in the evening and learned that we had accidentally made a reservation for the previous night instead of the night we arrived. The staff were very accommodating and were able to find a room for us at no extra charge. We were very thankful since the hotel was almost sold out. Thank you Best Western... More
__label__very_positive	I stayed at this hotel august 5th 2015, The room was really clean, great customer service. Friendly staff. The complimentary breakfast was good. Refrigerator and microwave in every room.
__label__very_negative	I'd look for an alternative
__label__very_positive	Great hotel/very helpful staff/pleasant stay
__label__negative	This hotel was the last choice available. Our expectations were already set low from having read previous reviews. The bathroom sink still had toothpaste and other scum dried on the vanity and bowl. The shower still had the soap bars from the previous guest(s) sitting in the niche. Overall, the room was dirty. We were very surprised that the Days Inn logo was allowed to be associated with this hotel.
__label__positive	Reservation staff friendly and helpful. Room was recently renovated and very nice. Room on back of hotel had a lot of highway noise and people socializing outside late at night. Hotel restaurant/bar had been renovated, but was poorly stocked. I had to go with my THIRD food AND beverage choice because they were out of most popular menu items. Staff kept disappearing outside and left customers waiting for service and checks.
__label__neutral	A medium hotell. Close to the trainstation an within 10 min travel to the AirPort. The food could been better ( had all incl) Very helpfull stab in the reception.
__label__positive	Good and Convenient

__label__negative	Turned down the bed and it didn't look like it had been changed! Overall the room was not very clean!
__label__neutral	Bed was hard as a rock. Didn't get the room we booked on hotels.com and hotels.com said we were booked for three nights but hotel only had us down for two nights. Arrived late at night after driving 10 hours only to find no room for us. The hallways, elevator restaurant were excruciatingly hot! The restaurant sucked... Poor service with lousy hours... Pool was dirty! I'll never stay here again!
__label__positive	Nice view hotel

__label__positive	Excellent location
__label__very_positive	So often when visiting a small town, we have our choice between the Super 8 and EconoLodge set or the decrepit Best Western. What a delight to have this extraordinarily clean and comfortable motel in Princeton, IL. Friendly, smiling, helpful staff who greeted us every time we entered the lobby. Perpetual coffee and a large selection of tea. Great pool.... More
__label__positive	Great Base of Operations
__label__very_positive	The hotel is in a great location. Very quiet but still by many attractions, food, and bars. The staff was friendly. It was Walking distance to everything! Would definitely recommend to friends and family.
__label__very_positive	It was great to get away for a few days. The hotel has friendly staff and the rooms were clean and a very nice size. The bed was comfortable. We slept well.
__label__positive	We had a single king size bedroom. It was quite large with many places to sit as well as a large bathroom. Everything was in good shape considering the age of the hotel. The bed was very comfortable as my back was aching when I got to the room from the drive. The hotel has a restaurant inside. Prices were typical of a fancier place 12 for sandwich with side 15-25 for an entry. I went to get food shortly after I arrived at the hotel and found a 10 off coupon for the restaurant and two free drink coupons on top of the two free breakfast coupons which we used the next day. My wife and I slept well for the first time in a long time as we didn't have the kids with us. Breakfast in the morning was different. They only open up half of the restaurant and you had to wait to be seated. Our wait was about 15 minutes, a couple with their two kids must have waited nearly 25-30 minutes to get a seat. And this was for a buffet style breakfast. I am use to a more sit yourself and help yourself approach. Maybe this way they can take special orders for guests that don't want the normal buffet. It seemed a little backwards as breakfast ended at 10:30 AM checkout was at 11:00 AM so if you didn't know you were going to have to wait that long you might miss out. Other than that we had a good time. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again.
__label__very_positive	Recommendation for all
__label__negative	Won't be back for a second visit.
__label__positive	Good stay
__label__very_positive	Nice hotel, great room, excellent decor.
__label__very_positive	Top of Time Square At check in I asked for an up grade to city view room. 37th floor over looking Times Square. Accommadations were great. Room was big with Fantastic view of the city. Staff were very friendly. Checked out the top View lounge which rotates and the 8th floor bar which I thought was the better of the two. Martinis were hugh. One draw back was the Elevator system.

__label__positive	This is a great little hotel. We had a wonderful view from the room and patio. Good size. Breakfast was great even had North American breakfast foods. Only issue was the two twin beds pushed together. That was very uncomfortable.
__label__very_positive	The hotel was spectacular, with elegance and beauty. My husband and I stayed in a balcony suite and had amazing views of Lake Como and the mountains. The view was absolutely breathtaking from morning to night. The breakfast and dinner was abundant and delicious,with a great accommodating wait staff.

__label__very_negative	Very poor service. First night, when checked in, assigned room was not made. Moved to different room. Next day, room was not made, again moved to another room. Hotel complex very shabby.
__label__very_positive	The lady who checked me in was extremely friendly and helpful. She let me know about restaurants and fast food places near the hotel. The room was clean. The breakfast was good for a hotel breakfast. I would stay at this hotel again if I am in this area.
__label__neutral	The price is ok. Staff is courteous. Check out time is 11:00 The bed is ok. The room is clean. The restroom smelled a little weird. I wasn't sure if the towel were clean or not (did not use them) because I am use to seeing really white towels. The room was a little noisy. I would hear footsteps on the top and in the morning you could hear like construction and traffic. Breakfast is complimentary and picked up a little before 10 although they tell you that it's over at 10. The place lookes nice from and clean from the outside. There is no charge for parking. Free internet.
__label__positive	Clean, quiet, comfortable
__label__positive	hotel stay
__label__positive	Loved having a suite plenty of room for our family of 5. The beds are awful, hard as a rock. The pool is a little small for a hotel of this size and in the shade a good portion of the afternoon. It's a cheap Uber ride to the parks and Target is directly acrossed the street.
__label__very_positive	Stayed for our anniversary in the White Eagle cabin. It was adorable!!!! The pictures online do not do it justice. It was the perfect place for a get away weekend. Very clean. Felt very welcome. Can't wait to go back!!!!
__label__negative	The back door to the parking lot was left unlocked at night so that anyone could walk in. Since my room was next to the door and the hotel is not in the best location, I didn't feel safe. Also, it doesn't have an elevator, so second floor access with bags was difficult.

__label__very_positive	This hotel is directly off the highway, gas station and convenience store is right next door. Nice restaurants were also close by within driving distance.
__label__very_positive	Best place ever, hands down. First time to NOLA, gets no better...
__label__neutral	Descent stay for two nights. We were on the bottom floor. Could here people snoring upstairs, which was frustrating. Also they advertise continental breakfast, but honestly it was nothing. We got there both mornings about 1 hour after they opened breakfast up and everything was basically cleared out except for a little cereal and milk. Thy only offered breakfast bakery items from containers which were all cleaned out. Also there was not a place to even sit to eat there. We always just went out for breakfast, so if you stay, be aware it doesn't come with a breakfast. The hotel is located right across from the main mall which was nice.
__label__very_positive	Incredible Hotel
__label__very_negative	Well... you need to get a handle on some things.
__label__positive	This was a comfortable, quiet place to stay but still close to the places we needed to be. Very friendly front desk staff the evening we checked in. The tile floors we very clean and nice but the couch sure needed to be cleaned. Having spots on the furniture you want to sit on is pretty gross. Clean the upholstery and I would rate this place excellent!

__label__very_positive	We stayed for two nights in Mexico City and were very happy with this location. After reading many reviews we wondered about staying in the historical zone. We were taking advantage of the Free walking tour in the morning so decided to stay here. We learned that the Historical center has been radically cleaned up over the past 5 years with new parks, pedestrian only streets and good security. The Fiesta was clean with nice size rooms and great bedding. The hotel restaurant serves a nice buffet breakfast. The location is right beside the popular Hyatt Hotel but much more affordable. We walked throughout the entire Historical district including out for restaurants at night. We took the subway to the Museum of Anthropology. The staff were very helpful and friendly.

__label__neutral	Weekend Stay
__label__neutral	Front desk staff were extremely accommodating to my grandparents request for an accessible room near mine. Also one of very few hotels to accept cash payment without a credit card hold. The hotel itself is extremely run down and is in desperate need of an interior update. The hotel does otherwise serve its purpose for a quick overnight stay.
__label__neutral	Great Hotel close to Shopping & Restaurants
__label__very_negative	I booked this hotel because I thought it was a Confort Inn hotel as it showed in the photo, and it was not. I was miss lead by the photo. The hotel is poorly taking care off. Lamp shades broken, dirty bedspread, clogged drain in the shower to mention some. It is a pitty because it is well located.
__label__very_positive	It was a quiet floor for it being the 2nd floor. Everything was good besides the mini fridge not working and no microwave in the room, but honestly I dont know if that was in the description of the room. Other than that, it was a nice stay.
__label__positive	This hotel was nice. Staff was great, room was clean, breakfast was delicious. It's slightly odd in its design, but our room was nice. The thing that threw me was that there is no A/C in the room. Which, in Early June is not really a huge problem. But I DO NOT like to be hot when I sleep and so I had to keep the patio door open while I slept. That was scary. Otherwise-liked it.
__label__negative	Pretty smelly...
__label__very_positive	Great job
__label__positive	Surprised
__label__positive	Mike at the Front desk has excellent customer service, and the other stuff are friendly as well. The hotel is clean and comfortable in a quiet setting. The breakfast is good and changes daily for the main buffet. The exercise room has great equipment. The only drawback is the carpet has seen better days as far as wear, but is clean.
__label__very_positive	Very nice hotel with great service and helpful staff. Check-out time is convenient, location is very good, valet parking was extremely convenient. If I had to nitpick and complain about something, it would be difficult to find anything that is a valid complaint.

__label__very_positive	Great location!
__label__very_negative	Finding bedbugs crawling all over the pillows and then all over the bed after the pillows were lifted was an utterly horrible experience. Less than 10 minutes after we got into the room, we left even though it was 4:30 in the morning and our flight had landed hours late and we were overtired. There was no question of asking for another room because if there are bedbugs in one room, you can just bet the entire hotel is infested.

__label__positive	This place had everything we could want. Room was spotless and adequate...not fancy but certainly met our needs in good order. Had a nice view of the ocean from the living room and the lanai and yes, we did see whales from our room. Pool was clean, after ten the place was SILENT, close enough to walk to many restaurants and bars, and overall we were very satified. No housekeeping so tell the kids to pick up after themselves. Rates were fair and the staff was very friendly. We'll be back.

I told them exactly what I wanted and they found one that exceeded all of my expectations. It was in a perfect location (I prefer not to be up in the mountains and I enjoy a stream view). It was extremely clean and had every amenity I could ask for! I will definitely use Elk Springs again!

__label__positive	Extremely well run efficient hotel with good facilities. We stayed in spring and its a shame the outdoor pools weren't heated by all in all pretty happy and very good value for money.
__label__very_positive	The only thing that wasn't the best was the wifi seemingly only worked well for one of us, but was Independence Day weekend so it may have been a due to increased number of guests. Also, we could hear the other guests at times so soundproofing may be a little weak. The room was beautiful, so nice and large and was great to have the kitchenette. The bed was great. Really appreciated the updates and the A/C.
__label__positive	A friend and I stayed here as a stop over on a multi day beach hike in the San Diego area. Very cute quaint lodging, clean, comfortable bed and great location. The furnishing were beautiful. There was a small refrigerator and coffee maker in the room and microwave in a common area. Met several nice, friendly travelers also stopping over there. Breakfast is not in the inn but they provide Panera vouchers and the store is a block and a half away.

__label__positive	Lovely hotel, lovely location, disappointing pool
__label__negative	There were three big black marks on carpet. Felt creepy and awkward. At least it didn't look like blood spots. And getting into the room, I must try three times to open.

__label__very_negative	I have to say this was the worse experience I have ever had at a hotel. Upon arrival there was 3 people in front of us in line. All 3 people were there to complain and to ask for their money back. There was 2 people wanting their money refunded due to bed bugs that they had found in their room and another asking for a refund because the hotel was unable to give them the accommodations that were promised. The man at front desk was very argumentative and rude. When it was our turn we immediately explained that we were a little nervous to stay based on what we just witnessed. His logic was we might as well stay here because he was not going to give our money back and in addition to that he was insisting that we pay him 20 in cash because our child is 15 and anyone over 14 must pay additional charge. I again explained that we was just worried about bed bugs and he said that it was fine because he had called exterminator and thus had done everything he could. He was unreasonable and rude. I left the lobby in tears. We decided to inspect the room and found items that had been left there from the previous customers all over the room. In my opinion anyone considering this hotel for your vacation should just keep looking.
__label__very_positive	staff has been great. not sure what other comments are based on. room is great and a huge tv!!
__label__positive	Nice Stay
__label__negative	The lady at the front desk was either on the phone on out of the office when I went there to get a key that would work. She was kinda rude after the third time she had to go unlock my room. I asked her if I was going to have to come over here all night long She did not say a word and went and unlocked my room and left. She was not very nice.
__label__positive	This was the perfect place for us. It was on the beach, tastefully decorated, clean and quiet. We thought we got a lot for our money and left saying we'd come back -- and recommend it to others.

__label__very_positive	Nice Place to Stay
__label__neutral	I was there for 3 days and 2 nights. The lobby area was nice. The breakfast in the morning was decent. The room was nice and quiet and the bed was very comfortable. What I did notice was that the hotel common areas were not very well maintained. The tile floor outside the elevators on my floor had coffee spills on them for the whole time I was there. The tile floor in one of the elevators was cracked and falling apart. The other elevator was missing the covers for the lights in the ceiling so the flourescent tubes were all exposed. The elevators were very slow and creaked alot. The carpet in the hallway in front of my room needed to be vacuumed very badly and it remained unvacuumed the whole time I was there. The pool area was nice and seemed to be kept clean. It seemed like with a little bit of effort it could look alot better.

__label__very_positive	I needed a break from driving on a long car trip so I stopped at this hotel. It was not right off the freeway which was a disappointment. However, when I went into town for dinner, I realized the extra drive was worth it. The town is a Victorian gem. The owner of the hotel was really nice. The rooms were typical for a motel. It was very clean. I would stay again if I need to stop along this stretch of 80.

__label__very_positive	Very relaxing and close to everything
__label__positive	Traveling for.14 hours and had a few major chains to choose from but when we called and brought up website this place looked good and was only 80.00 compared to the rest at over 100.00. We.were skeptical at first but very surprised with the accomodations. Very nice.size.room, comfortable beds and a full breakfast. Would highly recommend.
__label__positive	We had a single king size bedroom.  It was quite large with many places to sit as well as a large bathroom.  Everything was in good shape considering the age of the hotel.  The bed was very comfortable as my back was aching when I got to the room from the drive.  The hotel has a restaurant inside.  Prices were typical of a fancier place $12 for sandwich with side $15-25 for an entry.  I went to get food shortly after I arrived at the hotel and found a 10% off coupon for the restaurant and two free drink coupons on top of the two free breakfast coupons which we used the next day.  My wife and I slept well for the first time in a long time as we didn't have the kids with us.  Breakfast in the morning was different.  They only open up half of the restaurant and you had to wait to be seated.  Our wait was about 15 minutes, a couple with their two kids must have waited nearly 25-30 minutes to get a seat.  And this was for a buffet style breakfast.  I am use to a more sit yourself and help yourself approach.  Maybe this way they can take special orders for guests that don't want the normal buffet.  It seemed a little backwards as breakfast ended at 10:30 AM checkout was at 11:00 AM so if you didn't know you were going to have to wait that long you might miss out.  Other than that we had a good time.  The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful.  I would definitely stay here again.

__label__positive	This is a nice hotel. The room was nice and housekeeping kept the wash clothes in cute figures (dogs, flowers, basket). However, I don't think the carpet was cleaned everyday. There was a large white thread on the floor when I got there and was still there when I left. There were sugar ants in the bathroom, but this is a Florida thing, not many, but they were there. There was a dead bug in the corner that never left and on my last night and next morning, the TV wouldn't turn on. Haven't decided if I'd stay there again.

__label__very_positive	Great Location
__label__very_positive	Perfect hotel for family vacation. Plenty to do at the hotel, including programming for kids of all ages. Activities are geared both for kids to do on their own and to involve parents when they want. The hotel pool is great, overlooking the slopes and there are several hot tubs. Specific activities our family enjoyed were the magic show on Wed night, the smores nights and a few of the movies. Our 9 yo son loved the blast room (game room) and spent the day/night going back and forth between this area and the pool with his new friends. Next to the pool are several community grills, which many families used and we will next time. The location of the hotel at the mountain base is right next to unlimited outdoor activities, including zip lines, slides/coaster, chair lifts, mountain biking and hiking, mini golf and much more.

__label__positive	Breakfast was the best, and the best thing about the stay was the one and only host, great conversations at breakfast and advise on the city. Very nice neighborhood. Only reason that it did not get 5 stars is that the room has room for improvement, not any fault of the host. This is bed and breakfast, but not your honeymoon style BB, I would stay here again. Room comfort could improve with a new air conditioning unit, other then that five stars. Sharing the bathroom, never a problem, and coming in and out with you wanted never a problem. No need to rent a car, easy with public transportation.

__label__negative	On the website is rated as a 3-star hotel, but after actually staying there it is definitely not a 3 star. The remote for the TV in the bedroom would not work and or the TV was not functioning, even though I was warned that the thermostat has been turned down, the room was cold and I could not get it to heat up, and regardless of how long you ran the hot water in the bathroom sink it would not heat up. I love the layout of the suite and otherwise would have been quite nice.

__label__very_positive	Breakfast Buffet
__label__very_positive	We stayed here recently for four nights. The hotel closes for the winter from November through February. Overall very good experience, we had a triple room on the first floor and our room had a really nice large garden patio where we ate dinner under the stars a couple nights. Unbeatable view and comfortable room, although the room and the hotel are built in the 1920s and show it in places, but it was comfortable enough for us. The room is very large compared to others we had around Italy. Breakfast was good. The hotel front desk staff were helpful enough, and spoke adequate English, although some of them seemed a bit frazzled probably due to it being the end of their work season, I think they were closing for the winter the day after we left. Anyways, we had a great time and would recommend this hotel. Many of the hotel guests are tour groups, mostly retirement age folks from U.K. or Ireland, but we enjoyed meeting many of them upstairs at breakfast. If you are nervous, as I sometimes am, about traveling to places where many do not speak your language, you will feel very comfortable here.

__label__very_positive	"I was staying at the Marriott Marquis this week for a business conference. I needed additional print-outs made and headed down to the business center where I met Sue, one of those rare, disarmingly fantastic customer service people. I encountered a whole mess of technical difficulties. Sue kept making suggestions for work arounds, she got quite busy at several different times and somehow still made everyone feel heard and taken care of. I would have been frustrated with me 15 minutes after I walked in and she was so incredibly patient not only with me, but with every person who came in. When I left she handed me my copies and said ""You poor thing, having to be up here for a whole hour!"" As if I wasn't being an incredibly persistent, irritating, technically challenged pain in the ass. I don't even want to call my experience there ""customer service"", because that somehow feels processed. It was human kindness. And at a really stressful time, Sue helped me figure my problem out in a way that made me feel like a friend, not a customer. Thank You!"
__label__neutral	The hotel was very clean, staff was friendly. It is in an older part of town but there were plenty of places to eat or order in. Would stay again. Nice pool area and breakfast was plentiful. it is in close proximity to the Aquarium and the Queen Mary. We visited both.

__label__very_positive	Incredible place to stay! BEAUTIFUL!
__label__positive	Delighted with the hospitality, offerings and location. Easy to work with as a late arrival. Enjoyed heated pool and continental breakfast. Short walk to all the delights of Ogunquit. Dated yet clean. Only memorable surprise was the thin walls/exuberant sounds mistaken for TV.
__label__very_positive	Will definitely return!!!
__label__neutral	I reserved two rooms with two double beds. When I arrived I learned they gave all the double bed rooms to soccer teams who we're staying there. No coffee was left forge second day. The rooms were nice and large with a small kitchen w/table and two chairs , couch, sitting chair, and a work desk. I stay again.
__label__positive	Great Service
__label__very_positive	got in late but enjoyed the short time we stayed great room very clean looked almost new
__label__very_positive	I stayed 1 night here because I was out of town for a work conference. I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed my stay. The hotel is connected to the Convention Center via parking garage, which I found very convenient, especially on the rainy days. Check-in was fast and easy. The lobby was VERY clean. The snack/bar area was... More
__label__neutral	Alright for a one night stay in a very basic hotel with no frills. Everything seemed outdated and needs to be freshened up a bit. Continental breakfast was alright, but there wasn't any fruit to chose from, and only small tubs of peanut butter for protein. It was interesting to see the 1960's architecture of the building.
__label__very_positive	Great hotel for  family vacation
__label__very_negative	Awful place
__label__very_positive	Great place to stay
__label__positive	The hotel met our needs.
__label__positive	todos funcionarios atenciosos, e boa localizacao
__label__neutral	Staff does their jobs well and were friendly. Hotel is just older. You can hear everyone in your area. Bed wasn't super comfy. That's why it's less expensive. Great location. A block from the beach, golf, casino and about 10 minutes away from restraints.
__label__positive	Went for Punk Rock Bowling. Right in front of the Fremont Experience. Pretty cool. Parking is free once you check in and they'll reimburse the money you used to enter the first time. Bathroom had no window which was weird but got used to it. The best part was live bands playing at the pool. Freakin Angelic upstarts played for free. Dope

__label__very_negative	I paid in advance for my room which was supposed to have two beds (I was traveling with another female) and even though I could show that I paid for the tow-bed room in advance they charged me over a hundred dollars more at the end of my stay for the upgrade.

__label__very_positive	Very clean and quiet. My compliments to the staff that ran the breakfast buffet. She really takes pride in the service and quality. Clone her.
__label__very_negative	I had a confirmed 2 rooms booking to this hotel through hotels.com. When I tried to checkin at the hotel, the front desk person tells me he doesn't have any confirmation on my name. He squarely blamed it on hotels.com because of a computer glitch they had. I believe he double sold the rooms, as he was well aware of my name even before I told him mine. I would like you guys to double check and confirm your booking at this hotel
__label__positive	We only stopped for the night, the service was great, the room was comfortable. After being on the road all day, it was a pleasant experience. I would have liked a fitness center at the facility but there was access to a local gym next door so it worked out.
__label__neutral	Weekend in San Francisco
__label__positive	My son and I stayed for 2 days. Very basic but it was good enough for us. We just slept and shower it was good enough. Great location walking distance to everything close enough to the T . ( Subway). Only one thing there was the lobby / coffee station was not very clean.
__label__neutral	Nice updated room... but VERY cramped. Room next to me was blaring music and partying very loudly. I called the front desk about it, cuz I had been up since 5am for work and wanted some sleep. Nothing happened after the first call. Called again after midnight, they called the room, it quieted down for 5 min, and then they went back to partying. I think around 1:30 in the morning they passed out from partying. Very rude of the guests to do so, and I was extremely exhausted the next morning going back to work. There was also some dried pizza sauce or something on the bed's skirt around the bed.
__label__neutral	Our family used to be members and it was always one of our favorite places for special occasions because of the breathtaking location, impecible service and wonderful food. This trip was a mixed bag. Our room had a beautiful view and very comfortable amenities. Dinner and breakfast experiences... service was SO slow and staff so inattentive that both meals were... More

__label__very_positive	The Metropole hotel and our experience there was perfect. The hotel is on the Grand Canal near one of the Alilaguna/treghetti stops, so you can easily walk from public transportation from the airport. They have their own water taxi dock as well. The hotel itself is like a museum. It's like staying in an ancient but updated Venetian home. Service was impeccable. The employees are friendly, helpful, competent, and nice. The room was beautiful and clean. We didn't have much of a view, and the window was small so the room was dark. Room servicing was great. It was serviced twice a day. Facilities were clean and worked. We had breakfast there, and again the experience was perfection. We just wanted to spend the day sitting there, munching on fresh yogurt, fruit, pastries, and the best mozzarella balls anywhere. The hotel is also about a block from St. Mark's Square, and there is an ATM about 1/2 a block away. The street is lined with restaurants. This prime tourist area. Pack light if it's your first trip to Venice, there are no motorized vehicles in the city so you schlepp your bags...or take a water taxi and get dropped right at the hotel's doorstep. Loved this place.

__label__neutral	For the price of our room, we've better stays elsewhere. We were assigned a handicap room. Our room housed a king size bed and large bathroom.

__label__very_positive	"As a business traveler, I absolutely love staying at this hotel. Not only are the rooms comfortable and tastefully decorated, but the service is fantastic. The lobby is the ""place to be,"" with plenty of action, wine hour, and coffee/tea in the mornings. The location is perfect for me as well, with an unending supply of great restaurants and bars within walking distance. I also like the small touches in the room, like a hair dryer, extra space, and robes."

__label__positive	Great hotel
__label__positive	Lovely stay
__label__negative	We arrived to have the desk clerk tell us about the elevator being down and she only had a third floor room. She offered to carry our bags. Not an issue with us. The hotel seemed newly painted but obviously older. The shower had issues as did the sink. The room was clean. But no paper towels, pen, or paper. I have not stayed at this brand before but other brands have these basics. You can get dishes and such but we were there only one night. No glasses in the room. The vending machine only had soda, no water. The location is quiet, kind of an office park area. So not so easy to grab snacks and such. I suppose you could walk to the Residence Inn next door...

__label__positive	Despite checking in late, the staff that greeted us were absolutely wonderful. We had a fantastic trip and it was so amazing not having to worry about where we were staying. The location was perfect for going out, and right around the corner was an amazing restaurant called Eat New Orleans. The room was clean and just a few short blocks from Bourbon and Royale streets. Fantastic time, can't wait to come again!
__label__negative	Price Was Right But
__label__very_negative	The room was dirty. Carpet was torn and made our feet black when we walked on it. We would have found something else but the area was heavily booked. Thought this would be better than a motel. It wasn't
__label__neutral	It was a good hotel for that one night stay kind of a thing. Staff was great, bed was super nice, and location was perfect. It was just over used and cramped. It looked clean but did not feel clean. None smoking rooms smell like smoking rooms and burn marks in comforter.
__label__very_positive	There was four of us ,It was great!We will stay again.
__label__very_positive	This has to be the best place to stay in Paris - walking distance to the Eiffel tower, nearby shopping, and Champs de Elysees. The hotel itself is a contemporary art deco hotel. Small lobby and no actual front check in desk - I was taken back a bit - the service is individualized and personal - the staff are all very professional speak many different languages and on top of that they don't have typical set roles as in other BIG hotels - they all do everything! Best concierge service in Paris! The room itself was gorgeous - very hard to find rooms this big in Paris - King bed - big bathroom with tub - simply luxurious!

__label__very_positive	We stayed at this hotel since my daughter had a 3 day swim meet at GCIT. The hotel room was spotless and bed was extremely comfortable. We had great shower pressure and my daughter loved swimming in the pool between her sessions. As always loved having the kitchen for early breakfasts and late night dinners. Unfortunately we only ate the free breakfast once due to time constraints in the morning. Breakfast was very good with a good selection of hot and cold foods. Would absolutely stay at this hotel again.

This is a 4 star hotel I should not be going thru this inconvenience for an expensive room, I had to reduce my stay. Bad experience.

The rooms have a large kitchenette equipped with everything you could need--plates, pots, paper towels, full-sized refrigerator, etc. The hotel was nice, clean, spacious, and comfortable.

Am Pool ist es schn wenn da nicht gerade eine Schulung einer Firma draussen stattfindet das geht gar nicht ein riesen Lrm. Das Frhstck ist draussen im Zelt also schon etwas frisch am Morgen Butter war aus... Der Strand ist weit entfernt ca. 10min mit dem Auto. Gesamteindruck enttuschend maximal fr eine Nacht o.k.

__label__neutral	Place had too many animals and I'm allergic to pets...although I did receive a pet free room, there were pets every where in the lobby and elevators. I don't have anything against pets, but I am highly allergic therefore, people with allergies should be considered.
__label__very_negative	We stayed here to take an early flight the next day. Services did not exist. My wife and I struggled to take our suitcases up to the room while the bellhop was busy watching traffic outside. Hotel is below a busy flight path so we did not get to sleep at all despite being tired from a full day of walking and shopping in the city. The airport shuttle which was one of the reasons we choose to stay here does not start operation until 5 AM. Our flight was at six and we needed to be at the airport at 4 for check in. Overall, the hotel was a terrible place to stay.

__label__very_positive	The reason why I was so disappointed in my stay is first upon my arrival I do take notice as to the level of cleanliness of any establishment. The first thing that I notice is that the halls nor elevator had not been vacuumed during my whole duration. In fact I mentioned to Lady who checked me out how the... More

__label__very_positive	Another good and restful stay at Dtree in BC. This is the very best hotel in town. Our only mild disappointment was a complete lack of service in the bar on Sunday afternoon. Thankfully there are plenty of bars in downtown BC!
__label__positive	Decent hotel, price reasonable for Boston standards. Quite near to subway, so easy access to central Boston (less for Harvard/ MIT though!). Mattress a bit soft / worn out for my liking. Breakfast ok for US standards (not for European let alone Asian ones) but not very healthy. Although hotel staff (very friendly) and reviews announced that parking may not be available, we actually always had a place even when we arrived late (after 10 PM). Will probably return.

__label__very_positive	I reserved this room as a stopover on a long trip. I arrived late (after 10 pm) and was pleasantly pleased that it took about a minute and a half to check in. The rooms have exterior entrances, and there is a ramp up to the second floor which is convenient. The room was big and clean with fridge and microwave. Sink and mirror separate from shower. The hairdryer wasn't working in the morning and when I reported it, I received another one in about 5 minutes. It isn't fancy, but it was a pleasant surprise. No complaints.
__label__very_positive	Everything was great
__label__neutral	I stayed here for the River Rock weekend. I just needed somewhere to sleep that wasn't directly downtown pricing. The staff was nice and the hotel was pretty quite even though it's next to a main street.

__label__very_negative	This place was disgusting. I took one step inside the room and decided I could not stay. Nothing was clean. Everything was falling apart. I was afraid of catching an STD from the burnt comforter. The staff was ridiculously rude and the lobby reeked so badly of mold I had to hold my breath. I'm asking for my money back.
__label__positive	Elitch Gardens visit
__label__neutral	We stopped here for a night on our way to Gulf Shores, AL. Very cute, old style hotel right in the heart of downtown area. We arrived late and asked the front desk for some dinner recommendations. They suggested John's City Diner 4 blocks down since we wanted to walk. We were not disappointed! Felt safe walking there and back. Rooms were nice and clean, although the beds were definitely small and uncomfortable. Only complaint was the cost of parking overnight, 24 plus tip for valets... Metered street parking is available but they don't tell you that until after you surrender your keys.
__label__very_negative	Don't stay there, the picture shows a hotel style and we stayed in another building which is a motel. This was never mentioned when we reserved the room. The room was terrible, burn holes in the bed spread, shower handle broken, walls were damaged, and electrical plate cover in bathroom removed. This was the most disgusting motel I have ever... More

However, we were there for 3 nights and the room was never cleaned. We got back late both nights since we were at an amusement park and settled for clean towels after calling the front desk.

__label__very_negative	We stayed at the IP on July 10th and 11th weekend. We chose to stay here as we had tickets to see ZZ TOP. The auditorium was an excellent venue to see any concert in. We fully enjoyed the concert. The staff at the IP are very friendly and we did not find anyone that was not. We did not like the Hotel Room as it was probably the worst Casino Hotel room I have ever stayed in. The entire place especially in the Ho... view moretel rooms has a musky smell. It could be a smoke smell but we had a Non smoking room. Casino was fine but I will never stay at this Hotel again as for the smell and the actual rooms were much less than desirable. Nice friendly place but the Hotel part just sucks. Go here and Enjoy but I seriously recommend staying somewhere else.

__label__very_positive	I am a long-time VA resident and have never had the pleasure of staying here until last Dec 2011. I was pleasantly overwhelmed by the staff, the location, the accomodations, the pool area and the nearby shopping! THANK YOU! I desperately want to come back!

__label__very_negative	I did not enjoy this hotel. It was small and it smelt like smoke. I am not tolerant of smoke and even though this was a non-smoking room, it reeked of smoke. Maybe the vents carry other room's smell into our room. There were several mosquitoes in our room and bathroom and a lot of them right outside our room. It was scary to enter and exit. The front desk staff was friendly and helped us find excellent restaurants and places of interest.

__label__very_positive	We have stayed here yearly for 6 years. No, it isn't fancy but that isn't our top priority. We want a clean, comfortable room at a reasonable price and this is it. The complimentary breakfast is great and the room had a microwave and frig for snacks. we value the convenience of a ground floor room that allows us to park right outside our room...no elevators or hassles going back out to the car for something. There are several excellent eating places within yards. We'll be back next year!
__label__very_positive	Wonderful hotel on every level!
__label__negative	Cheap but rundown
__label__very_positive	Great Pet-friendly hotel!
__label__very_positive	Love the character of this little town people were welcoming and very friendly. We really enjoyed our stay.
__label__neutral	Breakfast was great! Location was not so good. However, if you're looking for a hotel to stay the night near the port then i would recommend this hotel.
__label__positive	Easy access to I70. About 25 minutes to downtown Indy. Room was a suite and it was huge and very clean with cook top and full size fridge. Would be great for extended stay. Plenty of restaurants in area. Thermostats in both rooms but I would suggest setting them low when heating. I set at 68 and woke up sweating.... More
__label__positive	The air conditioner was not working properly, it would not cool down the suite. It made for a very uncomfortable night. The television was old and a person had to use 2 remotes and there was no tv channel guide, had to call the front desk for help.
__label__positive	We stayed two nights. They were very accommodating for our family. The rooms were in great shape. The front desk staff were cordial. The breakfast was good as is typical for HIE. The hotel is hard to find because you can't see it from any roads. It's on a small back road and can't see it until you are right... More
__label__positive	Good weekend getaway
__label__neutral	Great property, we have stayed here many, many times, but you need to get the elevator working already!!!!!!!!! Also, DO NOT DISTURB, means do not disturb. Your work crew banged on our door at about 8:30AM to gain access to the room even though we had the sign prominently displayed on the outside of our door.
__label__very_positive	nice find
__label__very_positive	This is my second time staying here and I LOVE it

__label__very_positive	I would HIGHLY recommend anyone visiting the Smokey Mountain area/Gatlinburg to stay at Elk Springs. My husband and entire family were in awe of the spacious and well equipped cabins. It was really hard everyday to leave the cabin and enjoy the other sights of this wonderful city. They are close to Pigeon Forge and downtown Gatlinburg. Cabins are cozy,... More

__label__very_negative	Entire building wing of the hotel smelled terrible and the room smelled worse. Everything was damp and musty. The window was broken so could not be opened and the air conditioner barely worked.

__label__negative	Pretty good
__label__very_positive	Terrible service.  Been waiting 45 minutes an still don't have brunch.

__label__positive	Overall, our stay was pleasant. We always stay at the Holiday Inn Express when in Dahlonega.
__label__very_negative	AC wouldn't work - had to push to get a room change. It was 109* outside and it was obvious they had multiple open rooms.
__label__neutral	30-Oct
__label__positive	This is what I would consider a basic hotel. We were just traveling through and needed a place to stay. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was clean. Breakfast was plentiful and there was a spacious room for eating. Seriously strong water pressure. Front desk clerk gave a recommendation for dinner, which was very good.
__label__very_positive	This is a very nice, comfortable hotel. The service is excellent and all the staff were very friendly and helpful. Nice location in old town Alexandria about a mile from the King St. Metro station (shuttles to and from the hotel available by simply calling the concierge).We highly recommend this to anyone.
__label__positive	Stayed in this hotel to break up the drive to the Grand Canyon. It was perfect for that reason. Would stay again.

We were generally comfortable with two exceptions: the pillows are small (especially for a King bed), and the shower door was not sealed so it leaked quite a bit.... More
__label__very_positive	Will stay again
__label__very_positive	Great place. Clean rooms and comfy beds. A lot of kickbacks: free breakfast, WiFi, And dinner. Friendly staff. Close to eating establishments, OSU, high street, Columbus State and arena district. I will be back.
__label__very_positive	The Best Choice in Bryant/Benton Area
__label__very_negative	Really poor experience here. Checked in at night, into the last room available. The room smelled strongly of dog/pet and had a very dirty/musty feel. I'm not the type to complain, but kindly asked the front desk if there might be another option. She replied that I was in the pet room and said she probably wouldn't stay there either! Offered no apologies or refund options, so I went to the Hampton Inn across the street. Attempted to collect a refund and have not heard back from the management. I stay in a lot of hotels/motels around the country, and this was one of the poorest experiences I've had... just want to warn other potential guests! There are better alternatives nearby.
__label__very_positive	Staff was very nice and the room was clean and comfortable at a reasonable price. On way to Floria from Michigan. I would recommend this hotel. It is convenient off I-75 and many good choice of restaurants near by including my favorite Gondolier Italian restaurant.
__label__positive	Average hotel with higher end feel
__label__positive	This was a great place to stay, right on the beach. Setting is perfect, away from the noise of downtown area, but still close enough for you to walk a couple of mins to the shops. Updated furnishings, decoration adds to the ambience. It was my husband and I's 2 year anniversary which I noted on the reservation, and they went out of their way (without me asking for special requests) to add wine and truffles- very sweet! Spotless room, contemporary setting, super affordable. I would hav...view moree rated it 5 stars, but the walls are paper thin. The next door showers and voices in the other room was a bit disappointing, but other than that, the heated pool, continental breakfast all the other postives outweighed it. I didn't expect much from it intially because I was getting a discounted price - but it truly blew us away.view less

__label__very_positive	It was a great stay. This is not for a romantic couples weekend - this is a family friendly hotel with amenities for families. Will definitely be back.
__label__very_positive	Great Place to Stay
__label__neutral	Cheap, adequate place to stay near Lackland AFB
__label__very_positive	Nice rooms and awesomely cool place to hang nice everywhere. Service is top notch. Not your fathers hotel. Hallways a little erie with dark gray walls, white doors and yellow lights onver the doors. Other wise, it's all awesomely cool.

__label__very_positive	Super clean, very friendly staff, exceptional service all the way around! Breakfast was great with many choices, room was clean and very inviting and comfortable. Lots of pillows that were comfortable and the toiletries were great and smelled good. The pool area was very clean and well maintained. We will definitely stay here again!

__label__very_positive	I need to be clear - I have never stayed at this hotel. I booked it in error as part of a trip around New England and Canada.

__label__negative	great price and location
__label__neutral	Not Enough Beds!!
__label__very_positive	My daughter-in-law and I spent one night in a room with 2 doubles. We requested a room close to my sister and niece, and they gave us one next door. Everything worked. We were comfortable and had no complaints, except that they forgot to put the coffee maker in our room. However, the other room had one, and we enjoyed a good continental breakfast.
__label__very_positive	Clean and super cheap! So glad I stayed here instead of downtown
__label__positive	Close to highway. Convenient to restaurants and K Mart. Indoor pool was warm and clean. Breakfast included a good variety of hot and cold foods. Staff was friendly and went out of their way to make our short stay comfortable.

__label__negative	This trip was for a pleasant day at Oak Island It turn into a complete waste of time due to extreme traffic and construction in the area. The line was literally 10 mile back ups. Local traffic a mess Waiting in traffic to go to dinner for nearly 1-2 hrs. Hotel was a complete mess They had no key reader for your hotel room so every time you wanted to get back in you would have to get someone at front desk to let you in. What awful stay and a waste of my money!!! Would not recommend ! By the way they hide dirt well. Nasty
__label__negative	Thin walls.  You will hear people having sex.  If you're lucky, it's coming from your room.  If not, ear plugs.

__label__very_positive	Our flight leaving from Houston airport was canceled so we needed an emergency overnight stay. The shuttle arrived promptly. The staff was friendly the room was large and clean. Breakfast was fine. It's kind of in the middle of nowhere so don't stay here if you want to sample any kind of life in Houston. But we would definitely stay here again if we needed a layover.

__label__neutral	Twelve is a great spot if you have the right waiter. My bestfriend and I went on a Sunday evening in which they were not busy and yet our waiter still ignored us. The pizza was greasy and my martini glass was cracked. We sat for about 20 min before we were even greeted or acknowledged. Gave no info on menu placement. We had to wait to place our order while our waiter bypassed us several times. The atomsphere is great, but he ruined it by the terrible service. Food came out and he did not refill drinks or even offer. After we finished, I had to get up and find someone to get our waiter because we sat about 20 more mins with dirty dishes in our face and no check. Where's my waiter Then a non-english speaking guy comes to pick up the plates. How did he get a job, somebody please call INS. Where's my waiter Finally a manger tells me that she is sorry and he was running room service b/c she was short staffed. Not my problem. Then the Waiter gets irate w/me and tell me to pay him and not the manager. He never apologized for his lack of customer service. Don't expect much of the service to be great here.

__label__very_positive	My husband and I were in Grand Rapids for a concert at the DeVos Performance Center. While it was a 15 minute drive to our destination, we chose this hotel because we have stayed here before and had great service. As expected, we were not disappointed. We highly recommend this hotel. Every staff member we encountered was very nice,

__label__positive	Hotel Facing Lake Como
__label__neutral	okay hotel
__label__negative	The room was comfortable for the price. Hot Breakfast was a plus and the first morning was staffed by a very friendly gal named Pena. She was always making sure the food was restocked and to our liking. she was GREAT! The following morning was a different server and the eggs were watery, and the sausage gravy was really runny. Not appetizing at all. The attendant was a bit frantic at how busy it was and just told everyone to microwave the eggs to congeal them, she had to keep the people feed. We were also disappointed to see there wasn't a whirlpool, but the kids tried to enjoy the pool. It was far, far too cold in the pool room and impossible for anyone to tolerate. For the price, we thought whatever, but I wouldn't choose this particular hotel again, unless the changed a few things.
__label__positive	Great place to stay
__label__neutral	Check in was horrible. In line for 45min. Elevators very slow.
__label__positive	Location is terrific.Check in was fairly easy and quick.Room was nice. I got the 2 double bed room.There were a few quirks however. You have to ask for a separate mini-bar key, which i guess is acceptable and may be more common than i experience. Also, the pool is open odd hours - for example not before 10am on Saturday and Sunday and not between 10 and 2 weekdays, and they actually enforce this by not allowing the doors to open. The fitness equipment all worked, with the exception of the televisions attached to them. Also, TV advertised pay per view, but they must have changed it so it is not available. And finally, internet of course was expensive. i honestly believe i this day and age that wi-fi should be free.
__label__positive	Good Loc. on the way from Airport to Glacier Park
__label__negative	Just OK
__label__very_positive	This historic hotel is worth a stay. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. The bar and restaurant are good. Rooms are oversized and nice. Will definitely be back next year.

__label__very_positive	We stayed at the Comfort Suites across the parking lot from Harrah's in Bossier City, LA, last month. Being a new establishment was a plus for us.

__label__very_positive	The Smoky Mountains were closed due to the Government shutdown but we had a great time at Elk Springs Resort Serenity Lodge. A 5 bedroom, 4 bath cabin with so many amenities that we immediately felt comfortable and at home. Rocking chairs on the porch for snacks and drinks, and a fully equipped kitchen which we used to prepare several breakfasts and dinners. Evenings in the media room for movies, we will definitely be back !!
__label__very_negative	dirty place
__label__very_positive	Had a great time. Great for a group overnight. Happy hour and free breakfast.
__label__positive	We had to be at the VA early in the morning. Instead of traveling at 6 am to get there by 8 we decided to hotel it the prior evening. The staff was great, the hotel was clean, however, the interior walls could use a paint job. Without it the walls appear dirty and sad. Otherwise fine

__label__neutral	Disappointed stay.
__label__neutral	Short cab ride from airport, could hear some noises through the walls from other rooms and the street, full length mirror in odd place in room. A/C was off when first arriving caused the candy bars to melt that were available to purchase. Overall, clean and nice hotel.
__label__neutral	Not Good At All!!!
__label__positive	we used this as a stop to split up our driving, so we weren't there long. facilities were fine, not outstanding, but also not memoral
__label__very_negative	Hotel didn't honor our non-smoking room reservation. After treatening to leave they magically had a non-smoking room, shower was yellow, toilet had stains, TV was outdated with a Comcast remote (no Comcast box to be seen), table was blocking AC unit, and to top it off the door handle to get out was found on the floor when we shut the door. Needless to say we checked out a day early and didn't hear back from the manager that was supposed to contact us with our complaints. Contacted days inn personally to file our grievances
__label__positive	This hotel was great and the staff was even better. From handling multiple check-ins to information about the area and even following up on calling a taxi for me it was all great.
__label__very_negative	Holes in the curtains, burn holes in comforter and the towels had stains on them. A waste of money. If I wasn't so exhausted I would have just drove on.
__label__positive	Good for the price
__label__very_positive	A very accommodating hotel
__label__neutral	Just an average hotel. The sheets are clean and the bathroom was clean. The rooms are shabby and need up dating. But the price of the hotel reflects that. (inexpensive) The Family that runs it though is very nice and helpful. I felt safer knowing that everyone that worked there was from that family and they were not hiring people off the street to clean the rooms.
__label__very_positive	The Lake Motel provided just the perfect vacation experience for my family.

It's so easy to just pick up the phone and call the shuttle. We love the pool area and the outside grill. All of the staff is so friendly and the bus drivers are awesome! We look forward to coming there each year. Also our room had recently been remodeled it was a beautiful room!

__label__very_positive	Easy access from interstate. Spacious parking and well lit at night. Check-in was efficient and courteous. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Clean and tidy room. Breakfast great each morning and included cereals, fruits, breads, eggs, meats and yogurts. Juice and coffee well stocked and fresh. All as should be.
__label__neutral	Affordable hotel
__label__neutral	"The hotel was clean but in great need of a remodel. There was so much wallpaper, it was shocking. They also claim to be ""smoke free"" but they allow people to smoke right outside the door, with the door open. So being on the second floor the smoke went right up the stairs into our room. The room was also very drafty. We stayed in April, I can't imagine what it would have been like in January. All in all it was clean, but we wouldn't stay there again."
__label__neutral	Carpets are chocolate in color but one can still see the dirt. Bed was so too soft. AC went to sleep mode. Unable to clear that mode on the wall mounted thermostat. Breakfast was the same old-same old. Not one simple special dish or sample from south Florida's cuisine.
__label__positive	great place in mountain village. all amenities were solid except for steam room (wasn't working properly)..food at the bar was a huge bonus (great burger and salad) outdoor pool was great after imogene run.
__label__very_positive	Great little place, it's actually hotel sized rooms that are each purchased as real property, just as one would purchase a regular sized condo then rent it out. But it's run as a hotel. So if you had a problem with the hair dryer, as we did, you let the front desk know and they will sort it right away. Interesting concept but still a decent place to stay for a couple.
__label__neutral	Off season so many of the hotel and ski area amenities closed or cut back (glass of wine Catch the bus downtown). We would come back, but in season.
__label__positive	This is a lovely small hotel/Inn. We basically booked here because it was listed as dog friendly. I would recommend the Hotel even if we had no dog with us. Our early check in was approved with a smile, the room was clean and comfortable and the location was excellent, just across the street from the beach and waterfront and close to many restaurants. If you are not looking for a resort with upscale accommodations and prices to match, this is a great choice!
__label__positive	40 Berkeley has a great location and all of the staff members are very friendly. My single room was very clean and offered plenty of drawer and hanger space, along with a small table. Perfect for those on the budget in boston. It would be nice though if they cleaned the shared bathrooms/showers more often...by the end of the day... More
__label__very_negative	Look to door would not work. If we left during the night we could not get back in. Confined to room. A/c on high no nobs to turn down or off. Room was ice cold. Door to bathroom would not shut. No privacy. No other rooms, in the end the offered us a 9 refund. Worst hotel ever for me.
__label__positive	It was my first hostel, and has been better than expected. We were in 4 and stayed for 2 periods. In the firts we got a bedroom with 2 bunks, very limited space! Second time we got a 4 twin beds bedroom, much better! The bathroom are not gorgeous, but are fine. Recepcionists were very helpful. WiFi is fine too!!

__label__neutral	Pool small with no privacy glass. Stayed on the 10th floor, beautiful view of the ocean, peaceful hotel. Good hot breakfast was a plus. Only negative was the pool isnt very private, clear glass across from the ground floor elevators. We chose not tobswim because of that and it seemed small and crowded. Overall a great stay, well worth the money.

__label__very_positive	A comfortable stay on the way through.
__label__very_positive	Absolutely Lovely
__label__positive	The desk clerk suggested A Little Taste of Texas Caf for dinner. We tried it and were very pleasantly pleased! Thanks for the suggestion. We found our room to be very clean and the beds were comfortable. We did find a bug on one bed and a couple crawling on the ceiling. My wife wasn't pleased with that!
__label__neutral	Fabulous historic building. The staff were superb. All of them. Very impressive. The room was mostly good but the shower was unacceptably designed and water got all over the bathroom floor. This must be a different toom, the design of the shower is absurd. I had to use all the towels to sop up the water both times I showered.
