__label__negative	At nearly three hours , the whole of Safe Conduct is less than the sum of its parts .

__label__very_negative	Automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf .
__label__very_positive	Awkward but sincere and , ultimately , it wins you over .
__label__very_negative	Bad Company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script .
__label__very_negative	Bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description .

__label__neutral	Bears resemblance to , and shares the weaknesses of , too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences .
__label__negative	Before long , the film starts playing like General Hospital crossed with a Saturday Night Live spoof of Dog Day Afternoon .
__label__very_negative	Began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course .
__label__negative	Begins as a promising meditation on one of America's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt .
__label__neutral	Behan himself knew how to spin a tale and one can't help but think he'd appreciate this attempt to turn his life into art .
__label__positive	Behind the snow games and lovable Siberian huskies -LRB- plus one sheep dog -RRB- , the picture hosts a parka-wrapped dose of heart .
__label__negative	Being author Wells ' great-grandson , you'd think filmmaker Simon Wells would have more reverence for the material .
__label__neutral	Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan , Tom Clancy's intrepid hero ?
__label__positive	Benefits from a strong performance from Zhao , but it's Dong Jie's face you remember at the end .
__label__neutral	Bennett's dramatization of her personal descent into post-breakup perdition has a morbid appeal that's tough to shake .

__label__neutral	Both awful and appealing .

__label__neutral	Bourne , Jason Bourne .
__label__very_positive	Bow's best moments are when he's getting busy on the basketball court because that's when he really scores .
__label__positive	Branagh , in his most forceful non-Shakespeare screen performance , grounds even the softest moments in the angry revolt of his wit .

__label__neutral	Brimful .
__label__positive	Britney has been delivered to the big screen safe and sound , the way we like our 20-year-old superstar girls to travel on the fame freeway .
__label__very_positive	Bubba Ho-Tep is a wonderful film with a bravura lead performance by Bruce Campbell that doesn't deserve to leave the building until everyone is aware of it .
__label__very_negative	Bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
__label__positive	Bullock does a good job here of working against her natural likability .
__label__negative	But I wasn't .

__label__very_negative	But as a movie , it's a humorless , disjointed mess .
__label__positive	But based on CQ , I'll certainly be keeping an eye out for his next project .
__label__negative	But buying into sham truths and routine `` indie '' filmmaking , Freundlich has made just another safe movie .

__label__neutral	But if you expect light romantic comedy , good gosh , will you be shocked .
__label__neutral	But in 2002 , such revelations wilt .
__label__very_negative	But in its child-centered , claustrophobic context , it can be just as frightening and disturbing -- even punishing .
__label__positive	But it's emotionally engrossing , too , thanks to strong , credible performances from the whole cast .
__label__positive	But it offers plenty to ponder and chew on as its unusual relationship slowly unfolds .
__label__negative	But it pays a price for its intricate intellectual gamesmanship .
__label__very_negative	But like Bruce Springsteen's gone-to-pot Asbury Park , New Jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a City of ruins .
__label__negative	But like most rabbits , it seems to lack substance .
__label__positive	But some unexpected zigs and zags help .
__label__negative	But that's just the problem with it - the director hasn't added enough of his own ingredients .
__label__negative	But the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored .
__label__very_negative	But this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film .
__label__negative	But this time there's some mold on the gold .
__label__very_positive	But watching Huppert , a great actress tearing into a landmark role , is riveting .
__label__neutral	But what about the countless other people who'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ?
__label__negative	But what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing .
__label__very_positive	But what spectacular sizzle it is !
__label__neutral	But you'll definitely want the T-shirt .
__label__positive	By presenting an impossible romance in an impossible world , Pumpkin dares us to say why either is impossible -- which forces us to confront what's possible and what we might do to make it so .

__label__very_positive	Cedar takes a very open-minded approach to this sensitive material , showing impressive control , both visually and in the writing .

__label__neutral	Chalk it up to my adoration for both De Niro and Murphy , but I had a pretty good time with this movie - despite its myriad flaws .
__label__neutral	Chao was Chen Kaige's assistant for years in China .
__label__negative	Chaotic , self-indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it's ... like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature-length horror .
__label__negative	Characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better .
__label__very_positive	Chicago is , in many ways , an admirable achievement .
__label__very_positive	Chicago is sophisticated , brash , sardonic , completely joyful in its execution .
__label__very_positive	Children may not understand everything that happens -- I'm not sure even Miyazaki himself does -- but they will almost certainly be fascinated , and undoubtedly delighted .
__label__negative	Cho's fans are sure to be entertained ; it's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- I'm not one of them .
__label__very_positive	Cho's fearless in picking apart human foibles , not afraid to lay her life bare in front of an audience .
__label__very_negative	Choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy .
__label__positive	Christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their Lord as a luv-spreading Dr. Feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise God for delivering such an instant camp classic .
__label__positive	City by the Sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : It's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes .
__label__positive	Claude Miller airs out a tight plot with an easy pace and a focus on character drama over crime-film complications .
__label__positive	Clever , brutal and strangely soulful movie .
__label__negative	Cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke .
__label__negative	Collateral Damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9 \/ 11 , an antique , in the end .
__label__very_positive	Compelling as it is exotic , Fast Runner has a plot that rivals Shakespeare for intrigue , treachery and murder .
__label__positive	Compelling revenge thriller , though somewhat weakened by a miscast leading lady .
__label__negative	Consider the title's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept .
__label__negative	Considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well .
__label__negative	Consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than Ali G
__label__very_negative	Could The Country Bears really be as bad as its trailers ?
__label__negative	Could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes Fatal Attraction look like a classic by comparison ?
__label__very_negative	Credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter .
__label__negative	Credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment .
__label__positive	Credit must be given to Harland Williams , Michael Rosenbaum and Barry Watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves
__label__negative	Creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller .
__label__neutral	Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of cheese , indeed .
__label__positive	Culkin , who's in virtually every scene , shines as a young man who uses sarcastic lies like a shield .
__label__negative	Culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character .
__label__very_positive	Cute , funny , heartwarming digitally animated feature film with plenty of slapstick humor for the kids , lots of in-jokes for the adults and heart enough for everyone .
__label__neutral	Cuts right through the B.S. giving a big middle-fingered `` shut up '' to those who talk up what is nothing more than two guys beating the hell outta one another .
__label__neutral	D.J. Qualls as Indiana Jones ?
__label__very_positive	Daring , mesmerizing and exceedingly hard to forget .

__label__positive	Day is not a great Bond movie , but it is a good Bond movie , which still makes it much better than your typical Bond knock-offs .
__label__very_positive	Dazzling and sugar-sweet , a blast of shallow magnificence that only sex , scandal , and a chorus line of dangerous damsels can deliver .
__label__positive	De Niro and McDormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story's inability to create interest .
__label__very_negative	De Niro looks bored , Murphy recycles Murphy , and you mentally add Showtime to the pile of Hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal .
__label__very_negative	De Niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to Clint Eastwood in the lazy Bloodwork .
__label__very_positive	De Oliveira creates an emotionally rich , poetically plump and visually fulsome , but never showy , film whose bittersweet themes are reinforced and brilliantly personified by Michel Piccoli .
__label__negative	Demands too much of most viewers .
__label__negative	Demme's loose approach kills the suspense .
__label__very_positive	Denis and co-writer Michele Petin's impeccable screenplay penetrates with a rawness that that is both unflinching and tantalizing .
__label__very_negative	Denzel Washington's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony .
__label__very_negative	Desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats .
__label__negative	Despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director Peter Mattei's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy .
__label__negative	Despite a powerful portrayal by Binoche , it's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum .
__label__positive	Despite a story predictable enough to make The Sound of Music play like a nail-biting thriller , its heart is so much in the right place it is difficult to get really peeved at it .
__label__neutral	Despite all the talking , by the time the bloody climax arrives we still don't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another .
__label__neutral	Despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry , Witherspoon is just too dialed-up to be America's Sweetheart .
__label__positive	Despite its flaws , Secretary stays in your head and makes you question your own firmly held positions .
__label__neutral	Despite its good nature and some genuinely funny moments , Super Troopers suffers from a bad case of arrested development .
__label__neutral	Despite its many infuriating flaws -- not the least of which is Amy's self-absorbed personality -- Amy's O's honesty will win you over .
__label__neutral	Despite its title , Amy's Orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one .
__label__positive	Despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy .
__label__negative	Despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style .
__label__negative	Despite the premise of a good story ... it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles .
__label__very_positive	Despite what anyone believes about the goal of its makers , the show ... represents a spectacular piece of theater , and there's no denying the talent of the creative forces behind it .
__label__negative	Dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter .
__label__very_positive	Diane Lane shines in Unfaithful .

__label__negative	Director Brian Levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you'll find on a French poodle .
__label__neutral	Director Clare Kilner's debut is never as daft as it should have been .
__label__negative	Director Dirk Shafer and co-writer Greg Hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama .
__label__positive	Director Ferzan Ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building .
__label__positive	Director Kapur is a filmmaker with a real flair for epic landscapes and adventure , and this is a better film than his earlier English-language movie , the overpraised Elizabeth .
__label__negative	Director Nalin Pan doesn't do much to weigh any arguments one way or the other .
__label__positive	Director Rob Marshall went out gunning to make a great one .
__label__very_positive	Disney's live-action division has a history of releasing cinematic flotsam , but this is one occasion when they have unearthed a rare gem .
__label__neutral	Disney has always been hit-or-miss when bringing beloved kids ' books to the screen ... Tuck Everlasting is a little of both .
__label__neutral	Dissing a Bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick .
__label__very_positive	Disturbing and brilliant documentary .
__label__very_negative	Disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material .
__label__negative	Divertingly ridiculous , headbangingly noisy .
__label__very_positive	Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood may not be exactly divine , but it's definitely -- defiantly -- ya ya , what with all of those terrific songs and spirited performances .
__label__very_negative	Don't expect any surprises in this checklist of teamwork cliches ...
__label__negative	Don't let your festive spirit go this far .
__label__positive	Don't plan on the perfect ending , but Sweet Home Alabama hits the mark with critics who escaped from a small town life .
__label__very_negative	Don't waste your money .
__label__very_negative	Do not , under any circumstances , consider taking a child younger than middle school age to this wallow in crude humor .
__label__very_negative	Do we really need a 77-minute film to tell us exactly why a romantic relationship between a 15-year-old boy and a 40-year-old woman doesn't work ?
__label__negative	Doesn't amount to much of anything .
__label__very_positive	Does what a fine documentary does best : It extends a warm invitation into an unfamiliar world , then illuminates it fully and allows the larger implications of the journey to sink in unobtrusively .
__label__very_positive	Dolgin and Franco fashion a fascinating portrait of a Vietnamese-born youngster who eagerly and easily assimilated as an all-American girl with a brand new name in southern Tennessee .
__label__very_positive	Doug Liman , the director of Bourne , directs the traffic well , gets a nice wintry look from his locations , absorbs us with the movie's spycraft and uses Damon's ability to be focused and sincere .
__label__negative	Drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the - past numbness .
__label__negative	Dreary , highly annoying ... ` Some Body ' will appeal to No One .
__label__neutral	Drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that Three Seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality .
__label__positive	Droll caper-comedy remake of `` Big Deal on Madonna Street '' that's a sly , amusing , laugh-filled little gem in which the ultimate `` Bellini '' begins to look like a `` real Kaputschnik . ''
__label__negative	Dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm .
__label__neutral	Each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , Storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception .
__label__negative	Earnest but earthbound ... a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama\/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast .
__label__negative	Earnest falls short of its Ideal predecessor largely due to Parker's ill-advised meddling with the timeless source material .
__label__positive	Earns its laughs from stock redneck ` types ' and from the many , many moments when we recognize even without the Elizabethan prose , the play behind the thing .
__label__neutral	Easier to respect than enthuse over , Andersson's rigorous personal vision is not only distanced but distancing .
__label__very_positive	Eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work .
__label__very_negative	Ecks this one off your must-see list .
__label__positive	Edited and shot with a syncopated style mimicking the work of his subjects , Pray turns the idea of the documentary on its head , making it rousing , invigorating fun lacking any MTV puffery .
__label__neutral	Effective but too-tepid biopic
__label__very_positive	Effectively feeds our senses with the chilling sights and sounds from within the camp to create a completely numbing experience .
__label__negative	Egoyan's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious .
__label__very_positive	Eight Crazy Nights is a showcase for Sandler's many talents .
__label__neutral	Elicits more groans from the audience than Jar Jar Binks , Scrappy Doo and Scooby Dumb , all wrapped up into one .
__label__positive	Elling , portrayed with quiet fastidiousness by Per Christian Ellefsen , is a truly singular character , one whose frailties are only slightly magnified versions of the ones that vex nearly everyone .
__label__positive	Elling really is about a couple of crazy guys , and it's therapeutic to laugh along with them .
__label__very_positive	Emerges as something rare , an issue movie that's so honest and keenly observed that it doesn't feel like one .
__label__neutral	Enduring love but exhausting cinema .
__label__very_positive	Energetic and boldly provocative .
__label__very_positive	Engagingly captures the maddening and magnetic ebb and flow of friendship .
__label__neutral	Engrossing and affecting , if ultimately not quite satisfying .
__label__neutral	Enjoy it for what it is ; you can hate yourself later .
__label__positive	Enormously likable , partly because it is aware of its own grasp of the absurd .
__label__negative	Enough similarities to Gymkata and Howie Long's Firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs .
__label__very_negative	Enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment .
__label__neutral	Equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama .
__label__positive	Escapism in its purest form .
__label__negative	Ethan Hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the Beatnik generation and it's all over his Chelsea Walls .
__label__negative	Even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame .
__label__very_negative	Even by dumb action-movie standards , Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever is a dumb action movie .
__label__very_negative	Even die-hard fans of Japanese animation ... will find this one a challenge .
__label__negative	Even if Britney Spears is really cute , her movie is really bad .
__label__neutral	Even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission's worth of funny to keep it afloat .
__label__neutral	Even if the ride's a little bumpy , with a final lap that's all too suspiciously smooth , you gotta give director Roger Michell , best known for the superfluous Notting Hill , credit for trying .
__label__positive	Even if you can't pronounce `` gyro '' correctly , you'll appreciate much of Vardalos ' humor , which transcends ethnic boundaries .
__label__neutral	Even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to Belushi's easy-going likableness .
__label__negative	Even legends like Alfred Hitchcock and John Huston occasionally directed trifles ... so it's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like Zhang Yimou behind the camera for a yarn that's ultimately rather inconsequential .
__label__negative	Even the imaginative gore can't hide the musty scent of Todd Farmer's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 Alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship .
__label__very_negative	Even the unwatchable Soapdish is more original .
__label__negative	Even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy ... even for Disney .
__label__neutral	Even those who would like to dismiss the film outright should find much to mull and debate .
__label__positive	Even when foreign directors ... borrow stuff from Hollywood , they invariably shake up the formula and make it more interesting .
__label__very_positive	Even with all those rough edges safely sanded down , the American Insomnia is still pretty darned good .
__label__positive	Eventually , it wins you over .
__label__very_negative	Every bit as bogus as most Disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point .
__label__neutral	Every good actor needs to do his or her own Hamlet .
__label__neutral	Every so often a movie comes along that confirms one's worse fears about civilization as we know it .

__label__positive	Everytime you think Undercover Brother has run out of steam , it finds a new way to surprise and amuse .
__label__very_positive	Everywhere the camera looks there is something worth seeing .
__label__positive	Evokes a little of the fear that parents have for the possible futures of their children -- and the sometimes bad choices mothers and fathers make in the interests of doing them good .
__label__very_positive	Excellent acting and direction .
__label__negative	Expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially Seven , which director William Malone slavishly copies .
__label__negative	Extreme Oops - oops , ops , no matter how you spell it , it's still a mistake to go see it .
__label__very_negative	Extremely boring .
__label__negative	Extremely confusing .
__label__very_negative	Extremely dumb .
__label__negative	Fails to bring as much to the table .
__label__negative	Fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters .
__label__negative	Falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that aren't funny .
__label__very_positive	Fans of Behan's work and of Irish movies in general will be rewarded by Borstal Boy .
__label__positive	Fans of Nijinsky will savor every minute of Cox's work .

__label__positive	Far from perfect , but its heart is in the right place ... innocent and well-meaning .
__label__positive	Farrell ... thankfully manages to outshine the role and successfully plays the foil to Willis's world-weary colonel .
__label__neutral	Faultlessly professional but finally slight .
__label__negative	Feel bad for King , who's honestly trying , and Schwartzman , who's shot himself in the foot .
__label__negative	Feels less like it's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers .
__label__very_negative	Feels like one of those contrived , only-in - Hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating Oscar talk .
__label__negative	Feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention .
__label__neutral	Feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the Lifetime cable television network .
__label__neutral	Ferrara directs the entire film with the kind of detachment that makes any given frame look like a family's custom-made Christmas card .
__label__very_positive	Few films this year have been as resolute in their emotional nakedness .
__label__very_negative	Filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low .
__label__positive	Finally , a genre movie that delivers -- in a couple of genres , no less .

__label__negative	Fine acting but there is no sense of connecting the dots , just dots .
__label__negative	First good , then bothersome .
__label__positive	Fisher has bared his soul and confronted his own shortcomings here in a way ... that feels very human and very true to life .
__label__very_negative	Flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey .
__label__negative	Flashy , pretentious and as impenetrable as Morvern's thick , working-class Scottish accent .
__label__negative	Flat , but with a revelatory performance by Michelle Williams .
__label__negative	Flaunts its quirky excesses like a New Year's Eve drunk sporting a paper party hat .
__label__positive	Flavorful and romantic , you could call this How Martha Got Her Groove Back -- assuming , that is , she ever had one to begin with .
__label__neutral	Flawed but worthy look at life in U.S. relocation camps .
__label__negative	Flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising .
__label__negative	Flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind .
__label__positive	For Benigni it wasn't Shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but Pinocchio .
__label__negative	For Caine Lovers only .
__label__negative	For a film about two mismatched buddies , Crystal and De Niro share little screen time and even less chemistry .
__label__positive	For a good chunk of its running time , Trapped is an effective and claustrophobic thriller .
__label__negative	For a shoot - 'em - up , Ballistic is oddly lifeless .
__label__negative	For all its alleged youthful fire , XXX is no less subservient to Bond's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero .
__label__positive	For all its failed connections , Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood is nurturing , in a gauzy , dithering way .
__label__negative	For all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale .
__label__negative	For all its surface frenzy , High Crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer .
__label__neutral	For all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that Kapur tries to bring to The Four Feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear .
__label__very_negative	For anyone who grew up on Disney's 1950 Treasure Island , or remembers the 1934 Victor Fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor .
__label__very_positive	For anyone who remembers the '60s or is interested in one man's response to stroke , Ram Dass : Fierce Grace is worth seeking out .
__label__very_positive	For its seriousness , high literary aspirations and stunning acting , the film can only be applauded .
__label__very_negative	For me , this opera isn't a favorite , so it's a long time before the fat lady sings .
__label__positive	For the first time in several years , Mr. Allen has surpassed himself with the magic he's spun with the Hollywood empress of Ms. Leoni's Ellie .
__label__positive	For the first two-thirds of this sparklingly inventive and artful , always fast and furious tale , kids will go happily along for the ride .
__label__positive	For the most part , I Spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of Murphy's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies .
__label__neutral	For the most part , the ingredients are there .
__label__very_positive	Ford deserves to be remembered at Oscar time for crafting this wonderful portrait of a conflicted soldier .
__label__very_negative	Formula 51 is so trite that even Yu's high-energy action stylings can't break through the stupor .
__label__very_negative	Fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water .
__label__positive	Foster nails the role , giving a tight , focused performance illuminated by shards of feeling .
__label__neutral	Frailty isn't as gory or explicit .
__label__negative	Francophiles will snicker knowingly and you'll want to slap them .
__label__negative	Frenetic but not really funny .
__label__very_positive	Frida's artistic brilliance is undeniable -- it's among the most breathtakingly designed films I've ever seen .
__label__negative	Friday After Next has the same problem that Next Friday did -- it's called Where's Chris Tucker When You Need Him ?
__label__positive	From spiritual rebirth to bruising defeat , Vincent's odyssey resonates in a profound way , comparable to the classic films of Jean Renoir .
__label__positive	From the big giant titles of the opening credits to Elmer Bernstein's perfectly melodic score , Haynes gets just about everything right .
__label__negative	Frustratingly , Dridi tells us nothing about El Gallo other than what emerges through his music .
__label__very_positive	Full Frontal is the antidote for Soderbergh fans who think he's gone too commercial since his two Oscar nominated films in 2000
__label__very_positive	Full of profound , real-life moments that anyone can relate to , it deserves a wide audience .
__label__very_positive	Fuller would surely have called this gutsy and at times exhilarating movie a great yarn .
__label__positive	Funny and , at times , poignant , the film from director George Hickenlooper all takes place in Pasadena , `` a city where people still read . ''
__label__very_negative	Gangs of New York is an unapologetic mess , whose only saving grace is that it ends by blowing just about everything up .
__label__negative	Gee , a second assassin shot Kennedy ?
__label__very_positive	Genuinely touching because it's realistic about all kinds of love .
__label__negative	George , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please .
__label__positive	George Clooney proves he's quite a talented director and Sam Rockwell shows us he's a world-class actor with Confessions of a Dangerous Mind .
__label__positive	Gets under the skin of a man who has just lost his wife .
__label__neutral	Girls gone wild and gone civil again
__label__negative	Given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there isn't much .
__label__negative	Glib , satirical documentary that fudges facts , makes facile points and engages in the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism .
__label__positive	Gloriously goofy -LRB- and gory -RRB- midnight movie stuff .
__label__very_positive	Go see it and enjoy .
__label__negative	God help the poor woman if Attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional Yvan's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse .
__label__very_negative	Godawful boring slug of a movie .
__label__very_positive	Gollum's ` performance ' is incredible !
__label__very_positive	Good actress .
__label__negative	Good for a few unintentional laughs , `` Extreme Ops '' was obviously made for the `` XXX '' crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction .
__label__very_positive	Good movie .
__label__positive	Good ol' urban legend stuff .
__label__very_positive	Gosling provides an amazing performance that dwarfs everything else in the film .
__label__very_positive	Goyer's screenplay and direction are thankfully understated , and he has drawn excellent performances from his cast .
__label__positive	Grant gets to display his cadness to perfection , but also to show acting range that may surprise some who thought light-hearted comedy was his forte .
__label__neutral	Great story , bad idea for a movie .
__label__very_positive	Greene delivers a typically solid performance in a role that is a bit of a departure from the noble characters he has played in the past , and he is matched by Schweig , who carries the film on his broad , handsome shoulders .
__label__very_positive	Greengrass has delivered an undoubted stylistic tour-de-force , and has managed elements such as sound and cinematography with skill
__label__very_positive	Guaranteed to move anyone who ever shook , rattled , or rolled .
__label__very_negative	Guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens .
__label__negative	Guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things .
__label__very_negative	Had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago .
__label__neutral	Had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin .
__label__negative	Half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder ... would be more at home on a daytime television serial .
__label__very_positive	Hands down the year's most thought-provoking film .
__label__positive	Haneke challenges us to confront the reality of sexual aberration .
__label__neutral	Haneke keeps us at arm's length .
__label__positive	Happily for Mr. Chin -- though unhappily for his subjects -- the invisible hand of the marketplace wrote a script that no human screenwriter could have hoped to match .
__label__neutral	Hardly makes the kind of points Egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world .
__label__positive	Harsh , effective documentary on life in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories .
__label__positive	Has a shambling charm ... a cheerfully inconsequential diversion .
__label__neutral	Has all the poignancy of a Hallmark card and all the comedy of a Gallagher stand-up act .
__label__negative	Has it ever been possible to say that Williams has truly inhabited a character ?
__label__negative	Has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags .
__label__neutral	Has something to say ... but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller .
__label__negative	Has the feel of an unedited personal journal .
__label__very_positive	Having never been a huge fan of Dickens ' 800-page novel , it surprised me how much pleasure I had watching McGrath's version .
__label__very_positive	Hawke draws out the best from his large cast in beautifully articulated portrayals that are subtle and so expressive they can sustain the poetic flights in Burdette's dialogue .
__label__positive	Hayek is stunning as Frida and ... a star-making project .
__label__neutral	Haynes has so fanatically fetishized every bizarre old-movie idiosyncrasy with such monastic devotion you're not sure if you should applaud or look into having him committed .
__label__negative	He'd create a movie better than this .
__label__positive	He's Super Spy !
__label__neutral	He can scale a building like a super hero , he can out-stealth any agent , he'll get the girl .
__label__very_negative	He has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about .
__label__positive	He just wants them to be part of the action , the wallpaper of his chosen reality .
__label__positive	He simply presents his point of view that Ayurveda works .
__label__neutral	Heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension .
__label__negative	Helmer DeVito ... attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids ' TV and revenge .
__label__very_positive	Her delivery and timing are flawless .
__label__very_negative	Her film is unrelentingly claustrophobic and unpleasant .
__label__positive	Here's a British flick gleefully unconcerned with plausibility , yet just as determined to entertain you .
__label__negative	Here's a self-congratulatory 3D IMAX rah-rah .
__label__positive	Here , Adrian Lyne comes as close to profundity as he is likely to get .
__label__neutral	Here , thankfully , they are .
__label__negative	Herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among Germany and Eastern European Jews might have changed 20th-Century history is undermined by Ahola's inadequate performance .
__label__neutral	Hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it's heading .
__label__negative	Hey , who else needs a shower ?
__label__negative	High Crimes miscasts nearly every leading character .
__label__neutral	High on melodrama .
__label__positive	Highlights are the terrific performances by Christopher Plummer , as the prime villain , and Nathan Lane as Vincent Crummles , the eccentric theater company manager .
__label__very_positive	Hilarious , acidic Brit comedy .
__label__very_positive	Hilarious , touching and wonderfully dyspeptic .
__label__neutral	Hip-hop has a history , and it's a metaphor for this love story .
__label__very_positive	His characters are engaging , intimate and the dialogue is realistic and greatly moving .
__label__neutral	His warriors collide in balletic explosion that implies an underlying order throughout the chaos .
__label__neutral	Hits one out of the park for the ` they don't make 'em like that anymore ' department .
__label__neutral	Hmm .
__label__negative	Home Alone goes Hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even Steven Spielberg would know how to do .
__label__neutral	Hopkins .
__label__neutral	How anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us .
__label__very_negative	How did it ever get made ?
__label__very_negative	How on earth , or anywhere else , did director Ron Underwood manage to blow $ 100 million on this ?
__label__negative	However , it lacks grandeur and that epic quality often associated with Stevenson's tale as well as with earlier Disney efforts .
__label__neutral	However clever Nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release .
__label__very_positive	Hu and Liu offer natural , matter-of-fact performances that glint with sorrow , longing and love .
__label__very_positive	Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock are two such likeable actors .
__label__neutral	Human Nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control .
__label__negative	Human Nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal .
__label__neutral	Human Resources was a good , straightforward tale , but Time Out is better .
__label__very_positive	Huppert gives Erika a persona that is so intriguing that you find yourself staring hypnotically at her , trying to understand her and wondering if she'll crack .
__label__negative	I'd give real money to see the perpetrators of Chicago torn apart by dingoes .
__label__neutral	I'm afraid you won't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers B-flick with just a suspension of disbelief .
__label__negative	I'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you're the kind of person who has seen every Wim Wenders film of the '70s .
__label__neutral	I've heard that the fans of the first Men in Black have come away hating the second one .
__label__very_negative	I Spy is an embarrassment , a monotonous , disjointed jumble of borrowed plot points and situations .
__label__positive	I admired it , particularly that unexpected downer of an ending .
__label__very_positive	I admired this work a lot .
__label__neutral	I believe the message is in the messenger : The agent is a woman .
__label__negative	I can only imagine one thing worse than Kevin Spacey trying on an Irish accent , and that's sultry Linda Fiorentino doing the same thing .
__label__very_positive	I complain all the time about seeing the same ideas repeated in films over and over again , but The Bourne Identity proves that a fresh take is always possible .
__label__very_negative	I cry for I Spy -- or I would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-TV spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind .
__label__negative	I didn't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot .
__label__negative	I didn't laugh at the ongoing efforts of Cube , and his skinny buddy Mike Epps , to make like Laurel and Hardy 'n the hood .
__label__negative	I don't have an I Am Sam clue .
__label__positive	I don't know precisely what to make of Steven Soderbergh's Full Frontal , though that didn't stop me from enjoying much of it .
__label__positive	I don't think I've been as entranced and appalled by an Asian film since Shinya Tsukamoto's Iron Man .
__label__negative	I doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time Christmas really rolls around , but maybe it'll be on video by then .
__label__neutral	I enjoyed Time of Favor while I was watching it , but I was surprised at how quickly it faded from my memory .
__label__very_negative	I found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic .
__label__negative	I hate this movie
__label__very_negative	I hated every minute of it .
__label__neutral	I haven't seen one in so long , no wonder I didn't recognize it at first .
__label__negative	I just didn't care as much for the story .
__label__negative	I kept thinking over and over again , ' I should be enjoying this . '
__label__negative	I kept wishing I was watching a documentary about the wartime Navajos and what they accomplished instead of all this specious Hollywood hoo-ha .
__label__positive	I like Frank the Pug , though .
__label__very_positive	I like the new footage and still love the old stuff .
__label__very_positive	I love the way that it took chances and really asks you to take these great leaps of faith and pays off .
__label__very_positive	I loved it !
__label__positive	I loved looking at this movie .
__label__negative	I regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough .
__label__negative	I saw Knockaround Guys yesterday , and already the details have faded like photographs from the Spanish-American War ... It's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink .
__label__negative	I tried to read the time on my watch .
__label__negative	I was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness .
__label__very_negative	I watched the brainless insanity of No Such Thing with mounting disbelief .
__label__negative	I weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider Blue Crush to be an intelligent film about young women .
__label__very_positive	I whole-heartedly recommend that everyone see this movie -- for its historical significance alone .
__label__very_negative	I wish I could say `` Thank God It's Friday '' , but the truth of the matter is I was glad when it was over .
__label__neutral	I wonder what the reaction of Israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation .
__label__neutral	I wonder why .
__label__negative	I would have preferred a transfer down the hall to Mr. Holland's class for the music , or to Robin Williams's lecture so I could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve .
__label__negative	IHOPs don't pile on this much syrup .
__label__very_positive	Ice Cube holds the film together with an engaging and warm performance ...
__label__very_negative	If High Crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title .
__label__negative	If Kaufman kept Cameron Diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he'd have them mate .
__label__very_negative	If Melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna .
__label__negative	If Myers decides to make another Austin Powers movie , maybe he should just stick with Austin and Dr Evil .
__label__very_negative	If Shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why didn't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ?
__label__neutral	If it's another regurgitated action movie you're after , there's no better film than Half Past Dead .
__label__very_positive	If it's possible for a sequel to outshine the original , then SL2 does just that .
__label__very_positive	If it seems like a minor miracle that its septuagenarian star is young enough to be the nonagenarian filmmaker's son , more incredible still are the clear-eyed boldness and quiet irony with which actor and director take on life's urgent questions .
__label__positive	If it tried to do anything more , it would fail and perhaps explode , but at this level of manic whimsy , it is just about right .
__label__very_positive	If no one singles out any of these performances as award-worthy , it's only because we would expect nothing less from this bunch .
__label__positive	If nothing else , this movie introduces a promising , unusual kind of psychological horror .
__label__negative	If somebody was bored and ... decided to make a dull , pretentious version of Jesus ' Son , they'd come up with something like Bart Freundlich's World Traveler .
__label__neutral	If the ' 70's were your idea of a good time at the movies , this will make you very happy .
__label__neutral	If the message seems more facile than the earlier films , the images have such a terrible beauty you may not care .
__label__neutral	If there's a way to effectively teach kids about the dangers of drugs , I think it's in projects like the -LRB- unfortunately R-rated -RRB- Paid .
__label__neutral	If there's nothing fresh about Wannabes , which was written by Mr. DeMeo , who produced and directed the film with Charles A. Addessi , much of the time the movie feels authentic .
__label__negative	If this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called The Hills Have Antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins .
__label__negative	If this is an example of the type of project that Robert Redford's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it's time to rethink independent films .
__label__negative	If this is satire , it's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook .
__label__very_negative	If this is the Danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps .
__label__very_negative	If this is the resurrection of the Halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead .
__label__neutral	If this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called Beta Alpha Delta .
__label__very_positive	If this movie were a book , it would be a page-turner , you can't wait to see what happens next .
__label__negative	If we don't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get .
__label__very_positive	If you're like me , a sucker for a good old fashion romance and someone who shamelessly loves to eat , then Mostly Martha offers all the perfect ingredients to more than satisfy your appetite .
__label__very_negative	If you're looking for comedy to be served up , better look elsewhere .
__label__negative	If you're not a prepubescent girl , you'll be laughing at Britney Spears ' movie-starring debut whenever it doesn't have you impatiently squinting at your watch .
__label__very_negative	If you're not into the Pokemon franchise , this fourth animated movie in four years won't convert you -- or even keep your eyes open .
__label__negative	If you're not the target demographic ... this movie is one long chick-flick slog .
__label__positive	If you can get past the fantastical aspects and harsh realities of `` The Isle '' you'll get a sock-you-in-the-eye flick that is a visual tour-de-force and a story that is unlike any you will likely see anywhere else .
__label__negative	If you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still wouldn't add up to the time required to boil a four - minute egg .
__label__very_positive	If you liked such movies as Notting Hill , Four Weddings And A Funeral , Bridget Jones ' Diary or High Fidelity , then you won't want to miss About A Boy .
__label__very_positive	If you liked the 1982 film then , you'll still like it now .
__label__very_positive	If you love Motown music , you'll love this documentary .
__label__negative	If you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce .
__label__positive	If you sometimes like to go to the movies to have fun , Wasabi is a good place to start .
__label__negative	If you think that Jennifer Lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry Ben Affleck , wait till you see Maid in Manhattan .
__label__positive	If your senses haven't been dulled by slasher films and gorefests , if you're a connoisseur of psychological horror , this is your ticket .
__label__neutral	Illuminating if overly talky documentary .
__label__very_negative	Imagine a really bad community theater production of West Side Story without the songs .
__label__negative	Imagine if you will a Tony Hawk skating video interspliced with footage from Behind Enemy Lines and set to Jersey shore techno .
__label__negative	Imagine the James Woods character from Videodrome making a home movie of Audrey Rose and showing it to the kid from The Sixth Sense and you've imagined The Ring .
__label__neutral	Immediately .
__label__very_positive	Impresses you with its open-endedness and surprises .
__label__positive	In Adobo , ethnicity is not just the spice , but at the heart of more universal concerns .
__label__positive	In Fessenden's horror trilogy , this theme has proved important to him and is especially so in the finale .
__label__very_negative	In a normal screen process , these bromides would be barely enough to sustain an interstitial program on the Discovery Channel .
__label__neutral	In a word -- yes .
__label__very_positive	In his debut as a film director , Denzel Washington delivers a lean and engaging work .
__label__positive	In its ragged , cheap and unassuming way , the movie works .
__label__very_positive	In scope , ambition and accomplishment , Children of the Century ... takes Kurys ' career to a whole new level .
__label__negative	In the end , Punch-Drunk Love is one of those films that I wanted to like much more than I actually did .
__label__neutral	In the end , Ted Bundy's only justification is the director's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there's no larger point , and little social context .
__label__neutral	In the end , White Oleander isn't an adaptation of a novel .
__label__positive	In the process , they demonstrate that there's still a lot of life in Hong Kong cinema .
__label__negative	In the second half of the film , Frei's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives Nachtwey for self-analysis .
__label__neutral	Insomnia is involving .
__label__negative	Instead , we just get messy anger , a movie as personal therapy .
__label__negative	Instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film's more determined to become the next Texas Chainsaw Massacre .
__label__negative	Instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , Hart's War , like the St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl , waits until after halftime to get started .
__label__negative	Intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area .
__label__positive	Interacting eyeball-to-eyeball and toe-to-toe , Hopkins and Norton are a winning combination -- but Fiennes steals ` Red Dragon ' right from under their noses .
__label__positive	Intriguing and beautiful film , but those of you who read the book are likely to be disappointed .
__label__very_positive	Invincible is a wonderful movie .
__label__negative	Involving at times , but lapses quite casually into the absurd .
__label__neutral	Is it a total success ?
__label__neutral	Is it something any true film addict will want to check out ?
__label__positive	Isn't it great ?
__label__positive	Isn't quite the equal of Woo's best earlier work , but it's easily his finest American film ... comes close to recapturing the brilliance of his Hong Kong films .
__label__neutral	Is office work really as alienating as ` Bartleby ' so effectively makes it ?
__label__neutral	Is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of Wilco's last album ?
__label__negative	Is this progress ?
__label__neutral	It's a Count for our times .
__label__very_positive	It's a beautifully accomplished lyrical meditation on a bunch of despondent and vulnerable characters living in the renown Chelsea Hotel ...
__label__positive	It's a bittersweet and lyrical mix of elements .
__label__very_positive	It's a brave attempt to tap into the heartbeat of the world , a salute to the universal language of rhythm and a zippy sampling of sounds .
__label__positive	It's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it doesn't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor .
__label__neutral	It's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story .
__label__negative	It's a film that hinges on its casting , and Glover really doesn't fit the part .
__label__neutral	It's a flashy , star-splashed reduction .
__label__very_positive	It's a glorious groove that leaves you wanting more .
__label__very_positive	It's a good film -- not a classic , but odd , entertaining and authentic .
__label__negative	It's a great deal of sizzle and very little steak .
__label__positive	It's a hoot and a half , and a great way for the American people to see what a candidate is like when he's not giving the same 15-cent stump speech .
__label__positive	It's a humble effort , but spiced with wry humor and genuine pathos , especially between Morgan and Redgrave .
__label__positive	It's a minor comedy that tries to balance sweetness with coarseness , while it paints a sad picture of the singles scene .
__label__very_positive	It's a movie -- and an album -- you won't want to miss .
__label__negative	It's a movie forged in the fires of Chick Flick Hell .
__label__positive	It's a nicely detailed world of pawns , bishops and kings , of wagers in dingy backrooms or pristine forests .
__label__very_positive	It's a pleasure to see Seinfeld griping about the biz with buddies Chris Rock , Garry Shandling and Colin Quinn .
__label__positive	It's a refreshing change from the self-interest and paranoia that shape most American representations of Castro .
__label__positive	It's a sly wink to The Others without becoming a postmodern joke , made creepy by its `` men in a sardine can '' warped logic .
__label__neutral	It's a sometimes interesting remake that doesn't compare to the brilliant original .
__label__very_positive	It's a terrific American sports movie and Dennis Quaid is its athletic heart .
__label__neutral	It's a trifle .
__label__neutral	It's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition .
__label__positive	It's absolutely spooky how Lillard channels the Shagster right down to the original Casey Kasem-furnished voice .
__label__negative	It's all pretty cynical and condescending , too .
__label__positive	It's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you're more than six years old .
__label__very_positive	It's almost impossible not to be moved by the movie's depiction of sacrifice and its stirring epilogue in post-Soviet Russia .
__label__neutral	It's also clear from the start that The Transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film's shortcomings start to shine through .
__label__negative	It's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views .
__label__negative	It's also stupider .
__label__very_positive	It's also the year's sweetest movie .
__label__very_positive	It's amazingly perceptive in its subtle , supportive but unsentimental look at the Marks family .
__label__very_negative	It's an awfully derivative story .
__label__neutral	It's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances , but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable .
__label__positive	It's an example of sophisticated , challenging filmmaking that stands , despite its noticeable lack of emotional heft , in welcome contrast to the indulgent dead-end experimentation of the director's previous Full Frontal .
__label__positive	It's an old story , but a lively script , sharp acting and partially animated interludes make Just a Kiss seem minty fresh .
__label__very_positive	It's as close as we'll ever come to looking through a photographer's viewfinder as he works .
__label__negative	It's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun .
__label__positive	It's astonishing .
__label__very_negative	It's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school .
__label__negative	It's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit Cherish .
__label__positive	It's both a necessary political work and a fascinating documentary ...
__label__very_negative	It's difficult to say whether The Tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing -- I'm prepared to call it a draw .
__label__negative	It's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few big-name actors and cameos at a hokey script .
__label__very_negative	It's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff .
__label__positive	It's endearing to hear Madame D. refer to her husband as ` Jackie ' -- and he does make for excellent company , not least as a self-conscious performer .
__label__negative	It's fairly self-aware in its dumbness .
__label__negative	It's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high .
__label__neutral	It's fun , but a psychological mess , with Austin Powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet .
__label__neutral	It's fun , but the code-talk will fly right over everyone's head
__label__negative	It's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that Hollywood isn't laughing with us , folks .
__label__neutral	It's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile .
__label__very_negative	It's hard not to feel you've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story .
__label__negative	It's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins .
__label__neutral	It's haunting .
__label__negative	It's just a silly black genre spoof .
__label__very_negative	It's just incredibly dull .
__label__negative	It's laughing at us .
__label__positive	It's like a poem .
__label__very_negative	It's neither as romantic nor as thrilling as it should be .
__label__very_negative	It's never a good sign when a film's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma .
__label__positive	It's not exactly a gourmet meal but the fare is fair , even coming from the drive-thru .
__label__very_negative	It's not horrible , just horribly mediocre .
__label__positive	It's not so much enjoyable to watch as it is enlightening to listen to new sides of a previous reality , and to visit with some of the people who were able to make an impact in the theater world .
__label__neutral	It's not that Waiting For Happiness is a bad film , because it isn't .
__label__neutral	It's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie .
__label__very_positive	It's obviously struck a responsive chord with many South Koreans , and should work its magic in other parts of the world .
__label__negative	It's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold .
__label__neutral	It's often infuriatingly glib and posturing , and yet it has been made with great evident care and manages to deliver up the man in a way to arouse further curiosity in even the most unknowing viewer .
__label__very_positive	It's one of the most honest films ever made about Hollywood .
__label__very_positive	It's one of the saddest films I have ever seen that still manages to be uplifting but not overly sentimental .
__label__very_negative	It's painful .
__label__positive	It's predictable , but it jumps through the expected hoops with style and even some depth .
__label__negative	It's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people who can't come up with legitimate funny , and it's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed .
__label__very_positive	It's rare to find a film that dazzles the eye , challenges the brain , AND satisfies our lust for fast-paced action , but Minority Report delivers all that and a whole lot more .
__label__positive	It's rather like a Lifetime special -- pleasant , sweet and forgettable .
__label__negative	It's really yet another anemic and formulaic Lethal Weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness .
__label__very_negative	It's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic Oliver Parker intends to mangle next time .
__label__negative	It's so underwritten that you can't figure out just where the other characters , including Ana's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of Ana's future .
__label__very_positive	It's solid and affecting and exactly as thought-provoking as it should be .
__label__positive	It's still worth a look .
__label__very_positive	It's the best film of the year so far , the benchmark against which all other Best Picture contenders should be measured .
__label__positive	It's the cinematic equivalent of a good page-turner , and even if it's nonsense , its claws dig surprisingly deep .
__label__negative	It's the kind of movie you can't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you can't bring yourself to dislike it .
__label__positive	It's the kind of pigeonhole-resisting romp that Hollywood too rarely provides .
__label__neutral	It's this memory-as-identity obviation that gives Secret Life its intermittent unease , reaffirming that long-held illusions are indeed reality , and that erasing them recasts the self .
__label__neutral	It's too long , too repetitive , and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner .
__label__neutral	It's tough , astringent , darkly funny and ... well , it's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning .
__label__very_positive	It's traditional moviemaking all the way , but it's done with a lot of careful period attention as well as some very welcome wit .
__label__positive	It almost plays like Solaris , but with guns and jokes .
__label__negative	It becomes gimmicky instead of compelling .
__label__very_positive	It could change America , not only because it is full of necessary discussion points , but because it is so accessible that it makes complex politics understandable to viewers looking for nothing but energetic entertainment .
__label__positive	It dares to be a little different , and that shading is what makes it worthwhile .
__label__negative	It delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for Deeper Meaning .
__label__negative	It doesn't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality .
__label__very_negative	It doesn't help that the director and cinematographer Stephen Kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel .
__label__neutral	It doesn't quite deserve the gong , but there are more fascinating acts than `` Confessions of a Dangerous Mind . ''
__label__neutral	It doesn't quite work , but there's enough here to make us look forward to the Russos ' next offering .
__label__positive	It does succeed by following a feel-good formula with a winning style , and by offering its target audience of urban kids some welcome role models and optimism .
__label__positive	It extends the writings of Jean Genet and John Rechy , the films of Fassbinder , perhaps even the nocturnal works of Goya .
__label__very_negative	It feels like a community theater production of a great Broadway play : Even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original .
__label__very_positive	It further declares its director , Zhang Yang of Shower , as a boldly experimental , contemporary stylist with a bright future .
__label__neutral	It has a subtle way of getting under your skin and sticking with you long after it's over .
__label__positive	It has fun being grown up .
__label__very_positive	It has the courage to wonder about big questions with sincerity and devotion .
__label__positive	It helps that Lil Bow Wow ... tones down his pint-sized gangsta act to play someone who resembles a real kid .
__label__positive	It helps that the central performers are experienced actors , and that they know their roles so well .
__label__neutral	It is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie ... but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made Eurotrash cult object .
__label__positive	It is a film that will have people walking out halfway through , will encourage others to stand up and applaud , and will , undoubtedly , leave both camps engaged in a ferocious debate for years to come .
__label__very_positive	It is a kickass , dense sci-fi action thriller hybrid that delivers and then some .
__label__positive	It is also , at times , curiously moving .
__label__positive	It is far from the worst , thanks to the topical issues it raises , the performances of Stewart and Hardy , and that essential feature -- a decent full-on space battle .
__label__very_positive	It is inspirational in characterizing how people from such diverse cultures share the same human and spiritual needs .
__label__very_positive	It is intensely personal and yet -- unlike Quills -- deftly shows us the temper of the times .
__label__positive	It is interesting and fun to see Goodall and her chimpanzees on the bigger-than-life screen .
__label__neutral	It is nature against progress .
__label__positive	It is not a mass-market entertainment but an uncompromising attempt by one artist to think about another .
__label__neutral	It is now .
__label__positive	It is ridiculous , of course ... but it is also refreshing , disarming , and just outright enjoyable despite its ridiculousness .
__label__very_positive	It is risky , intelligent , romantic and rapturous from start to finish .
__label__positive	It is so refreshing to see Robin Williams turn 180 degrees from the string of insultingly innocuous and sappy fiascoes he's been making for the last several years .
__label__neutral	It may be a prize winner , but Teacher is a bomb .
__label__negative	It may be an easy swipe to take , but this Barbershop just doesn't make the cut .
__label__negative	It might as well have been Problem Child IV .
__label__positive	It might be tempting to regard Mr. Andrew and his collaborators as oddballs , but Mr. Earnhart's quizzical , charming movie allows us to see them , finally , as artists .
__label__neutral	It might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a Three's Company-style laugh track .
__label__very_positive	It never fails to engage us .
__label__very_positive	It represents better-than-average movie-making that doesn't demand a dumb , distracted audience .
__label__negative	It risks seeming slow and pretentious , because it thinks the gamble is worth the promise .
__label__neutral	It seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less .
__label__negative	It settles for being merely grim .
__label__very_positive	It should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit .
__label__negative	It smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original .
__label__positive	It suggests the wide-ranging effects of media manipulation , from the kind of reporting that is done by the supposedly liberal media ... to the intimate and ultimately tragic heartache of maverick individuals like Hatfield and Hicks .
__label__positive	It takes this never-ending confusion and hatred , puts a human face on it , evokes shame among all who are party to it and even promotes understanding .
__label__neutral	It tells more than it shows .
__label__very_negative	It took 19 predecessors to get THIS ?
__label__negative	It tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world .
__label__very_positive	It turns out to be a cut above the norm , thanks to some clever writing and sprightly acting .
__label__neutral	It ultimately stands forth as an important chronicle of the abuses of one of Latin America's most oppressive regimes .
__label__positive	It uses an old-time formula , it's not terribly original and it's rather messy -- but you just have to love the big , dumb , happy movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding .
__label__negative	It virtually defines a comedy that's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while .
__label__neutral	It wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy .
__label__negative	It will come as no surprise that the movie isn't scary .
__label__very_positive	It will delight newcomers to the story and those who know it from bygone days .
__label__neutral	It will probably prove interesting to Ram Dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture .
__label__negative	It won't be long before you'll spy I Spy at a video store near you .
__label__neutral	It won't bust your gut -- and it's not intended to -- it's merely a blandly cinematic surgical examination of what makes a joke a joke .
__label__neutral	It won't rock any boats but is solid meat-and-potatoes filmmaking .
__label__very_negative	It would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun .
__label__neutral	It would be interesting to hear from the other side , but in Talk to Her , the women are down for the count .
__label__neutral	It would have benefitted the dialogue .
__label__very_negative	It wouldn't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $ 7.00 .
__label__negative	Its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper .
__label__positive	Its direction , its script , and Weaver's performance as a vaguely discontented woman of substance make for a mildly entertaining 77 minutes , if that's what you're in the mood for .
__label__negative	Its gross-out gags and colorful set pieces ... are of course stultifyingly contrived and too stylized by half .
__label__negative	Its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent Dumas botch-jobs , The Man in the Iron Mask and The Musketeer .
__label__negative	Its mysteries are transparently obvious , and it's too slowly paced to be a thriller .
__label__negative	Its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops .
__label__negative	Its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing .
__label__positive	Its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time .
__label__very_negative	Its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : Since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ?
__label__neutral	Ja Rule and Kurupt should have gotten to rap .
__label__positive	Jacquot's Tosca is a treat .
__label__positive	Jagger the actor is someone you want to see again .
__label__positive	Japan's premier stylist of sex and blood hits audiences with what may be his most demented film to date .
__label__positive	Jason X has cheesy effects and a hoary plot , but its macabre , self-deprecating sense of humor makes up for a lot .
__label__very_negative	John Leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie .
__label__very_negative	John McTiernan's botched remake may be subtler than Norman Jewison's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga .
__label__neutral	Johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to .
__label__negative	Jolie's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips .
__label__very_negative	Julia is played with exasperating blandness by Laura Regan .
__label__negative	Just a bloody mess .
__label__very_negative	Just another fish-out-of-water story that barely stays afloat .
__label__negative	Just because it really happened to you , honey , doesn't mean that it's interesting to anyone else .
__label__neutral	Just how extreme are these ops ?
__label__very_negative	Just like Hearst's enormous yacht , it's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination .
__label__neutral	Just like every other Seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail .
__label__very_negative	Just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story .
__label__neutral	Just one problem : Fish out of water usually die .
__label__neutral	Just what makes us happy , anyway ?
__label__negative	Just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos .
__label__negative	K-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy Saving Private Ryanovich .
__label__neutral	Karmen moves like rhythm itself , her lips chanting to the beat , her long , braided hair doing little to wipe away the jeweled beads of sweat .
__label__positive	Katz uses archival footage , horrifying documents of lynchings , still photographs and charming old reel-to-reel recordings of Meeropol entertaining his children to create his song history , but most powerful of all is the song itself
__label__positive	Kaufman creates an eerie sense of not only being there at the time of these events but the very night Matthew was killed .
__label__very_positive	Kinnear gives a tremendous performance .
__label__negative	Kwan makes the mix-and - match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action .
__label__very_negative	Lacking gravitas , MacDowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel .
__label__very_negative	Lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose .
__label__very_negative	Lame , haphazard teen comedy .
__label__negative	Lanie's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she's driven by ambition and Doesn't Know How to Have Fun .
__label__neutral	Largely a for-fans artifact .
__label__very_positive	Lathan and Diggs have considerable personal charm , and their screen rapport makes the old story seem new .
__label__very_positive	Lauren Ambrose comes alive under the attention from two strangers in town - with honest performances and realistic interaction between the characters , this is a coming-of-age story with a twist .
__label__neutral	Lawrence preaches strictly to the converted .
__label__very_positive	Lead provocatuers Testud and Parmentier give superlative performances
__label__very_positive	Leave it to Rohmer , now 82 , to find a way to bend current technique to the service of a vision of the past that is faithful to both architectural glories and commanding open spaces of the city as it was more than two centuries ago .
__label__very_negative	Leave these Flowers unpicked -- they're dead on the vine .
__label__negative	Leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness .
__label__positive	Led by Griffin's smartly nuanced performance and enthusiasm , the cast has a lot of fun with the material .
__label__positive	Lee Jeong-Hyang tells it so lovingly and films it so beautifully that I couldn't help being captivated by it .
__label__positive	Legendary Irish writer Brendan Behan's memoir , Borstal Boy , has been given a loving screen transferral .
__label__very_negative	Let's cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : Stay home .
__label__negative	Let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested .
__label__negative	Life is a crock -- or something like it .
__label__neutral	Light , cute and forgettable .
__label__very_positive	Like Dickens with his passages , McGrath crafts quite moving scenes throughout his resolutely dramatic variation on the novel .
__label__negative	Like Mike doesn't win any points for originality .
__label__neutral	Like a documentary version of Fight Club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest .
__label__negative	Like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it .
__label__negative	Like a south-of-the-border Melrose Place .
__label__very_negative	Like a tone-deaf singer at a benefit concert , John Q. is a bad movie appearing on behalf of a good cause .
__label__negative	Like its two predecessors , 1983's Koyaanisqatsi and 1988's Powaqqatsi , the cinematic collage Naqoyqatsi could be the most navel-gazing film ever .
__label__negative	Like most Bond outings in recent years , some of the stunts are so outlandish that they border on being cartoonlike .
__label__negative	Like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness .
__label__positive	Like old myths and wonder tales spun afresh .
__label__very_negative	Like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in The Twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten .
__label__positive	Like the film's almost anthropologically detailed realization of early - '80s suburbia , it's significant without being overstated .
__label__negative	Like those to Rome , all roads in The Banger Sisters inevitably lead to a joke about Hawn's breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them .
__label__neutral	Lilia's transformation from strict mother to sensual siren is superficially preposterous , but Abbas infuses the role with an unimpeachable core of emotional truth .
__label__negative	Liman , of Swingers and Go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase .
__label__neutral	Literally nothing in The Pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980's this one should appease you for 90 minutes .
__label__negative	Little more than a frothy vanity project .
__label__neutral	Long after you leave Justine , you'll be wondering what will happen to her and wishing her the best -- whatever that might mean .
__label__positive	Longley has constructed a remarkably coherent , horrifically vivid snapshot of those turbulent days .
__label__positive	Look , this is a terrific flick replete with dazzling camera-work , dancing and music .
__label__negative	Looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a Mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter's imagination .
__label__very_negative	Looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due .
__label__positive	Lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically .
__label__neutral	Lucas , take notes .
__label__very_negative	Made by jackasses for jackasses .
__label__very_negative	Madonna still can't act a lick .
__label__positive	Maguire is a surprisingly effective Peter\/Spider-Man .
__label__positive	Majidi's poetic love story is a ravishing consciousness-raiser , if a bit draggy at times .
__label__positive	Majidi gets uniformly engaging performances from his largely amateur cast .
__label__very_positive	Makes S&M seem very romantic , and Maggie Gyllenhaal is a delight .
__label__positive	Makes an aborbing if arguable case for the man's greatness .
__label__positive	Makmalbaf follows a resolutely realistic path in this uncompromising insight into the harsh existence of the Kurdish refugees of Iran's borderlands .
__label__neutral	Manages to be original , even though it rips off many of its ideas .
__label__very_negative	Marisa Tomei is good , but Just A Kiss is just a mess .
__label__negative	Mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor .
__label__negative	Marries the amateurishness of The Blair Witch Project with the illogic of Series 7 : The Contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie .
__label__positive	Marvelous , merry and , yes , melancholy film .
__label__very_negative	Matthew McConaughey tries , and fails , to control the screen with swaggering machismo and over-the-top lunacy .
__label__negative	Maudlin and melodramatic we expected .
__label__positive	May be spoofing an easy target -- those old ' 50's giant creature features -- but ... it acknowledges and celebrates their cheesiness as the reason why people get a kick out of watching them today .
__label__negative	Maybe I found the proceedings a little bit too conventional .
__label__negative	Maybe it's asking too much , but if a movie is truly going to inspire me , I want a little more than this .
__label__neutral	Maybe it's just because this past year has seen the release of some of the worst film comedies in decades ... But honestly , Analyze That really isn't all that bad .
__label__negative	Maybe it's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul `` Full Frontal '' seems , well , contrived .
__label__negative	McKay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
__label__very_negative	Meandering , sub-aquatic mess : It's so bad it's good , but only if you slide in on a freebie .
__label__neutral	Melanie eventually slugs the Yankee .
__label__negative	Men in Black II has sequel-itis something fierce .
__label__positive	Merchant effectively translates Naipaul's lively mix of characters from the page to screen .
__label__positive	Merely as a technical , logistical feat , Russian Ark marks a cinematic milestone .
__label__positive	Message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ?
__label__negative	Might have been better off as a documentary , with less of Mr. Eyre's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage .
__label__very_positive	Mixes likeable personalities , inventive photography and cutting , and wall-to-wall toe-tapping music to paint a picture of a subculture that is at once exhilarating , silly , perverse , hopeful and always fun .
__label__neutral	Mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty .
__label__negative	Mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness .
__label__negative	Moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance .
__label__very_positive	Moore's complex and important film is also , believe it or not , immensely entertaining , a David and Goliath story that's still very much playing itself out .
__label__positive	Moore's performance impresses almost as much as her work with Haynes in 1995's Safe .
__label__negative	Moot point .
__label__positive	More a load of enjoyable , Conan-esque claptrap than the punishing , special-effects soul assaults the Mummy pictures represent .
__label__positive	More honest about Alzheimer's disease , I think , than Iris .
__label__positive	More than makes up for its mawkish posing by offering rousing spates of genuine feeling .
__label__neutral	Morrissette's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit -- but it doesn't signify a whole lot either .
__label__very_positive	Morton is , as usual , brilliant .
__label__neutral	Morton is a great actress portraying a complex character , but Morvern Callar grows less compelling the farther it meanders from its shocking start .
__label__very_positive	Most impressive , though , is the film's open-ended finale that refuses to entirely close its characters ' emotional wounds .
__label__positive	Most new movies have a bright sheen .
__label__positive	Most of Crush is a clever and captivating romantic comedy with a welcome pinch of tartness .
__label__negative	Most of the action setups are incoherent .
__label__very_negative	Most of the supporting characters in Eastwood films are weak , as are most of the subplots .
__label__neutral	Movies like this are selling the old European candor , the old wink of ` bold ' revelation .
__label__very_positive	Mr. Parker has brilliantly updated his source and grasped its essence , composing a sorrowful and hilarious tone poem about alienated labor , or an absurdist workplace sitcom .
__label__positive	Mr. Wedge and Mr. Saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well .
__label__positive	Ms. Fulford-Wierzbicki is almost spooky in her sulky , calculating Lolita turn .
__label__very_positive	Much monkeyfun for all .
__label__very_positive	Much of the way , though , this is a refreshingly novel ride .
__label__negative	Much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie .
__label__very_negative	Murder By Numbers is like a couple of mediocre TV-movie - of-the-week films clumsily stuck together .
__label__negative	Murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous .
__label__very_positive	Murderous Maids may well be the most comprehensive of these films and also strike closest to the truth .
__label__positive	Must be seen to be believed .
__label__very_positive	Must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry .
__label__positive	My goodness , Queen Latifah has a lot to offer and she seemed to have no problem flaunting her natural gifts .
__label__very_positive	My oh my , is this an invigorating , electric movie .
__label__negative	My response to the film is best described as lukewarm .
__label__negative	Myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another .
__label__positive	Nair does capture the complexity of a big family and its trials and tribulations ...
__label__positive	Narc may not get an ` A ' for originality , but it wears its B-movie heritage like a badge of honor .
__label__very_negative	National Lampoon's Van Wilder could be the worst thing to come out of National Lampoon since Class Reunion
__label__negative	Nearly surreal , dabbling in French , this is no simple movie , and you'll be taking a risk if you choose to see it .
__label__very_negative	Needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey .
__label__very_negative	Neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well-drawn .
__label__positive	Nervy and sensitive , it taps into genuine artistic befuddlement , and at the same time presents a scathing indictment of what drives Hollywood .
__label__negative	Never Again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds .
__label__negative	Never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful .
__label__negative	Never mind whether you buy the stuff about Barris being a CIA hit man .
__label__negative	Never quite transcends jokester status ... and the punchline doesn't live up to Barry's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery .
__label__very_negative	New Best Friend shouldn't have gone straight to video ; it should have gone straight to a Mystery Science Theater 3000 video .
__label__very_positive	Newton draws our attention like a magnet , and acts circles around her better known co-star , Mark Wahlberg .
__label__positive	Nicely serves as an examination of a society in transition .
__label__very_positive	Nicolas Philibert observes life inside a one-room schoolhouse in northern France in his documentary To Be and to Have , easily one of the best films of the year .
__label__negative	No , it's not nearly as good as any of its influences .
__label__very_negative	No , it's the repetition of said behavior , and so Children of the Century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else .
__label__negative	No more .
__label__negative	No movement , no yuks , not much of anything .
__label__negative	No number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story .
__label__neutral	No question .
__label__very_negative	No reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned bucks into a movie which obviously didn't invest much into itself either .
__label__neutral	No wonder they're talking about `` Talk to Her . ''
__label__neutral	No worse than a lot of the crap we've been offered this summer , and slightly better than Men in Black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go .
__label__negative	No. .
__label__positive	Nolan bravely treads where few American films dare to delve -- into the world of ambivalence and ambiguity ...
__label__negative	None of these characters resembles anyone you've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter .
__label__negative	None of this violates the letter of Behan's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor .
__label__negative	Not ` terrible filmmaking ' bad , but more like , ' I once had a nightmare like this , and it's now coming true ' bad .
__label__positive	Not a bad journey at all .
__label__neutral	Not a cheap slasher flick , as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey .
__label__positive	Not a cozy or ingratiating work , but it's challenging , sometimes clever , and always interesting , and those are reasons enough to see it .
__label__negative	Not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it's almost funny .
__label__neutral	Not as distinctive or even as humorous as its needs to be to stand out , but it has clearly been made with affection and care .
__label__very_negative	Not even the Hanson Brothers can save it
__label__negative	Not every animated film from Disney will become a classic , but forgive me if I've come to expect more from this studio than some 79-minute after-school `` cartoon '' .
__label__positive	Not everything works , but the average is higher than in Mary and most other recent comedies .
__label__positive	Not for everyone , but for those with whom it will connect , it's a nice departure from standard moviegoing fare .
__label__negative	Not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality , it fails the most basic relevancy test as well .
__label__negative	Not so much a movie as a picture book for the big screen .
__label__negative	Not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined TV amiability that Allen personifies .
__label__negative	Not sweet enough to liven up its predictable story and will leave even fans of hip-hop sorely disappointed .
__label__positive	Not too far below the gloss you can still feel director Denis Villeneuve's beating heart and the fondness he has for his characters .
__label__negative	Nothing Denis has made before , like Beau Travil and Nenette et Boni , could prepare us for this gory , perverted , sex-soaked riff on the cannibal genre .
__label__negative	Nothing about it fits .
__label__very_negative	Nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and Showtime is crammed full of them .
__label__very_negative	Nothing more than a mediocre trifle .
__label__negative	Nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about .
__label__negative	Notorious C.H.O. has oodles of vulgar highlights .
__label__very_positive	Novak manages to capture a cruelly hilarious vein of black comedy in the situation with his cast of non-actors and a gritty , no-budget approach .
__label__negative	Now , if it only had a brain .
__label__very_negative	Now it's a bad , embarrassing movie .
__label__negative	Now it's just tired .
__label__positive	Now trimmed by about 20 minutes , this lavish three-year-old production has enough grandeur and scale to satisfy as grown-up escapism .
__label__positive	Noyce's film is contemplative and mournfully reflective .
__label__neutral	Noyce films it more as a shocking history lesson than as drama .
__label__very_negative	Obstacles are too easily overcome and there isn't much in the way of character development in the script .
__label__negative	Obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of Hey Arnold !
__label__positive	Occasionally , in the course of reviewing art-house obscurities and slam-bam action flicks , a jaded critic smacks into something truly new .
__label__neutral	Occasionally amateurishly made but a winsome cast and nice dialogue keeps it going .
__label__positive	Occasionally funny and consistently odd , and it works reasonably well as a star vehicle for Zhao .
__label__positive	Occasionally melodramatic , it's also extremely effective .
__label__very_negative	Oedekerk wrote Patch Adams , for which he should not be forgiven .
__label__negative	Offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented .
__label__very_positive	Offers a breath of the fresh air of true sophistication .
__label__neutral	Offers an unusual opportunity to observe the inequities in the death penalty , not just the inherent immorality but also the haphazard administration of it and public misperception of how the whole thing works .
__label__very_positive	Offers enough playful fun to entertain the preschool set while embracing a wholesome attitude .
__label__very_positive	Offers that rare combination of entertainment and education .
__label__negative	Oft-described as the antidote to American Pie-type sex comedies , it actually has a bundle in common with them , as the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough
__label__very_positive	Often gruelling and heartbreaking to witness , but Seldahl and Wollter's sterling performances raise this far above the level of the usual maudlin disease movie .
__label__very_positive	Often hilarious , well-shot and , importantly , entertaining , Hell House is a fascinating document of an event that has to be seen to be believed .
__label__neutral	Often moving and explores the discomfort inherent in the contacts between the American ` hosts ' and their ` guests . '
__label__neutral	Oh , it's extreme , all right .
__label__very_positive	On its own cinematic terms , it successfully showcases the passions of both the director and novelist Byatt .
__label__negative	On the right track to something that's creepy and effective ... It's just going to take more than a man in a Bullwinkle costume to get there .
__label__positive	On the surface , it's a lovers-on-the-run crime flick , but it has a lot in common with Piesiewicz's and Kieslowski's earlier work , films like The Double Life of Veronique .
__label__positive	Once again , director Jackson strikes a rewarding balance between emotion on the human scale and action\/effects on the spectacular scale .
__label__negative	Once the audience figure out what's being said , the filmmaker's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care .
__label__positive	Once you get into its rhythm ... the movie becomes a heady experience .
__label__negative	One Hour Photo is an intriguing snapshot of one man and his delusions ; it's just too bad it doesn't have more flashes of insight .
__label__negative	One groan-inducing familiarity begets another .
__label__negative	One minute , you think you're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it's as though clips from The Pink Panther Strikes Again and\/or Sailor Moon have been spliced in .
__label__very_positive	One of the best examples of how to treat a subject , you're not fully aware is being examined , much like a photo of yourself you didn't know was being taken .
__label__very_positive	One of the best of the year .
__label__very_positive	One of the greatest family-oriented , fantasy-adventure movies ever .
__label__very_positive	One of the greatest romantic comedies of the past decade .
__label__positive	One of the most haunting , viciously honest coming-of-age films in recent memory .
__label__negative	One of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating .
__label__very_positive	One of those rare , exhilarating cinematic delights that gets even better in hindsight , as you mull over its every nuance in your mind .
__label__positive	One scarcely needs the subtitles to enjoy this colorful action farce .
__label__neutral	Only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry .
__label__very_positive	Only an epic documentary could get it all down , and Spike Lee's Jim Brown : All American at long last gives its subject a movie worthy of his talents .
__label__neutral	Only two words will tell you what you know when deciding to see it : Anthony .
__label__negative	Opens as promising as any war\/adventure film you'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled `` Glory : A Soldier's Story . ''
__label__very_negative	Opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist's death bed and doesn't get much livelier in the three hours in between .
__label__neutral	Or , you can do something fun tonight .
__label__neutral	Or Tom Green as Han Solo ?
__label__neutral	Or a profit .
__label__negative	Or some damn thing .
__label__negative	Ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive .
__label__very_negative	Others may find it migraine-inducing , despite Moore's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding .
__label__negative	Outrageousness is all Plympton seemed to be going for this time .
__label__neutral	Over-the-top and a bit ostentatious , this is a movie that's got oodles of style and substance .
__label__negative	Overall , the film misses the brilliance of Jelinek's novel by some way .
__label__positive	Painful to watch , but viewers willing to take a chance will be rewarded with two of the year's most accomplished and riveting film performances .
__label__very_positive	Parker holds true to Wilde's own vision of a pure comedy with absolutely no meaning , and no desire to be anything but a polished , sophisticated entertainment that is in love with its own cleverness .
__label__neutral	Parker probably thinks he's shaking up a classic the way Kenneth Branagh and Baz Luhrmann have , but this half-hearted messing-about just makes us miss Wilde's still-contemporary play .
__label__neutral	Part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas , but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole .
__label__neutral	Passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless .
__label__neutral	Passion , lip-synching , tragedy , and lots of really really high notes .
__label__positive	Perhaps no picture ever made has more literally showed that the road to hell is paved with good intentions .
__label__very_negative	Philip K. Dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach .
__label__negative	Places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller .
__label__negative	Plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights .
__label__negative	Plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial .
__label__neutral	Polished Korean political-action film is just as good -- and bad -- as Hollywood action epics .
__label__neutral	Possession is Elizabeth Barrett Browning meets Nancy Drew , and it's directed by ... Neil LaBute .
__label__positive	Pray's film works well and will appeal even to those who aren't too familiar with turntablism .
__label__negative	Preposterous and tedious , Sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure .
__label__positive	Presents an astute appraisal of Middle American musical torpor and the desperate struggle to escape it .
__label__negative	Pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick .
__label__positive	Pretty darn good , despite its smarty-pants aura .
__label__negative	Proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism ... and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday's weather report .
__label__negative	Propelled not by characters but by caricatures .
__label__very_negative	Proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie .
__label__very_positive	Provides an intriguing window into the imagination and hermetic analysis of Todd Solondz .
__label__negative	Pryor Lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs .
__label__negative	Pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless Todd Solondzian satire and callow student film .
__label__negative	Punish the vehicle to adore the star .
__label__neutral	Purely propaganda , a work of unabashed hero worship , it is nonetheless -- and likely inadvertently -- a timely and invaluable implicit reminder of the role that U.S. foreign policy has played in the rise of Castro .
__label__negative	Quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ?
__label__positive	Quite funny for the type of movie it is ...
__label__very_positive	Rain is a small treasure , enveloping the viewer in a literal and spiritual torpor that is anything but cathartic .
__label__negative	Rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down .
__label__very_negative	Rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next .
__label__very_positive	Ranging from funny to shattering and featuring some of the year's best acting , Personal Velocity gathers plenty of dramatic momentum .
__label__very_positive	Ranks among Willams ' best screen work .
__label__very_positive	Rare is the ` urban comedy ' that even attempts the insight and honesty of this disarming indie .
__label__very_positive	Rarely do films come along that are as intelligent , exuberant , and moving as Monsoon Wedding .
__label__negative	Rates an ` E ' for effort -- and a ` B ' for boring .
__label__very_negative	Rather , you'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief .
__label__positive	Rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation .
__label__negative	Ray Liotta and Jason Patric do some of their best work in their underwritten roles , but don't be fooled : Nobody deserves any prizes here .
__label__neutral	Recalls quiet freak-outs like L'Avventura and Repulsion .
__label__negative	Reggio's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified Nike ad .
__label__negative	Reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film .
__label__positive	Reign of Fire may be little more than another platter of reheated Aliens , but it's still pretty tasty .
__label__positive	Reinforces the often forgotten fact of the world's remarkably varying human population and mindset , and its capacity to heal using creative , natural and ancient antidotes .
__label__positive	Reinforces the talents of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman , creator of Adaptation and Being John Malkovich .
__label__neutral	Remains a solid , if somewhat heavy-handed , account of the near-disaster ... done up by Howard with a steady , if not very imaginative , hand .
__label__very_positive	Remarkably accessible and affecting .
__label__negative	Remember when Bond had more glamour than clamor ?
__label__very_positive	Renner's performance as Dahmer is unforgettable , deeply absorbing .
__label__very_positive	Resourceful and ingenious entertainment .
__label__very_positive	Rich in detail , gorgeously shot and beautifully acted , Les Destinees is , in its quiet , epic way , daring , inventive and refreshingly unusual .
__label__very_negative	Ridiculous .
__label__negative	Ritchie's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people's faces to the fact Amber is such a joke .
__label__positive	Roger Michell , who did an appealing job directing Persuasion and Notting Hill in England , gets too artsy in his American debut .
__label__positive	Roman Coppola may never become the filmmaker his Dad was , but heck -- few filmmakers will .
__label__very_positive	Romanek keeps the film constantly taut ... reflecting the character's instability with a metaphorical visual style and an unnerving , heartbeat-like score .
__label__very_positive	Run , don't walk , to see this barbed and bracing comedy on the big screen .
__label__negative	Sadly , Hewitt's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks .
__label__negative	Safe Conduct , however ambitious and well-intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull's - eye .
__label__positive	Sam Jones became a very lucky filmmaker the day Wilco got dropped from their record label , proving that one man's ruin may be another's fortune .
__label__positive	Sandra Nettelbeck beautifully orchestrates the transformation of the chilly , neurotic , and self-absorbed Martha as her heart begins to open .
__label__negative	Say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue .
__label__negative	Scarlet Diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it's a lot less sensational than it wants to be .
__label__negative	Scene-by-scene , things happen , but you'd be hard-pressed to say what or why .
__label__negative	Schindler's List it ain't .
__label__very_negative	Schmaltzy and unfunny , Adam Sandler's cartoon about Hanukkah is numbingly bad , Little Nicky bad , 10 Worst List bad .
__label__positive	Scores a few points for doing what it does with a dedicated and good-hearted professionalism .
__label__neutral	Scotland , PA. blurs the line between black comedy and black hole .
__label__very_negative	Scotland , Pa. is a strangely drab romp .
__label__negative	Screenwriters Scott Abbott and Michael Petroni have turned Rice's complex Akasha into a cartoon monster .
__label__neutral	Search it out .
__label__neutral	Secret Ballot is too contemplative to be really funny .
__label__very_positive	Sensitive , insightful and beautifully rendered film .
__label__neutral	Sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary .
__label__very_positive	Serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in America in 2002 .
__label__negative	Sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution .
__label__neutral	Several degrees shy of the gross-out contests one expects from current teen fare .
__label__very_negative	Shadyac shoots his film like an M. Night Shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension .
__label__positive	Shainberg weaves a carefully balanced scenario that is controlled by neither character , is weirdly sympathetic to both and manages to be tender and darkly comic .
__label__very_negative	Shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme .
__label__very_positive	Sharp , lively , funny and ultimately sobering film .
__label__negative	She lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs .
__label__positive	She must have a very strong back .
__label__neutral	Sheridan ... smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth .
__label__negative	Shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker's bottomless pit of self-absorption .
__label__negative	Shot perhaps ` artistically ' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by Joaquin Baca-Asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity .
__label__negative	Showtime is closer to Slowtime .
__label__very_negative	Showtime is one of the hapless victims of the arrogant `` if we put together a wry white man and a chatty black man and give them guns , the movie will be funny '' syndrome .
__label__positive	Sits uneasily as a horror picture ... but finds surprising depth in its look at the binds of a small family .
__label__positive	Skip work to see it at the first opportunity .
__label__negative	Sluggishly directed by episodic TV veteran Joe Zwick , it's a sitcom without the snap-crackle .
__label__positive	Smart science fiction for grown-ups , with only a few false steps along the way .
__label__positive	Smith's approach is never to tease , except gently and in that way that makes us consider our own eccentricities and how they are expressed through our homes .
__label__very_positive	Smith's point is simple and obvious -- people's homes are extensions of themselves , and particularly eccentric people have particularly eccentric living spaces -- but his subjects are charmers .
__label__positive	Smith profiles five extraordinary American homes , and because the owners seem fully aware of the uses and abuses of fame , it's a pleasure to enjoy their eccentricities .
__label__neutral	So I just did .
__label__neutral	So faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check .
__label__negative	So few movies explore religion that it's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler .
__label__negative	So lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun .
__label__positive	So many documentaries like this presuppose religious bigotry or zealous nuttiness of its antagonists , but Family Fundamentals displays a rare gift for unflinching impartiality .
__label__neutral	So relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something .
__label__negative	So routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated Final Draft computer program .
__label__very_negative	So stupid , so ill-conceived , so badly drawn , it created whole new levels of ugly .
__label__very_negative	So what is the point ?
__label__very_positive	So young , so smart , such talent , such a wise \*\*\* .
__label__positive	Solid , lump-in-the-throat family entertainment that derives its power by sticking to the facts .
__label__very_negative	Some , like Ballistic , arrive stillborn ... looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future .
__label__positive	Some actors have so much charisma that you'd be happy to listen to them reading the phone book .
__label__neutral	Some actors steal scenes .
__label__negative	Some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations .
__label__positive	Some movies are like a tasty hors-d'oeuvre ; this one is a feast .
__label__very_negative	Some of Seagal's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot .
__label__negative	Some studio pizazz might have helped .
__label__neutral	Somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional .
__label__negative	Somehow we're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become G.I. Jane .
__label__neutral	Sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well .
__label__positive	Sometimes , nothing satisfies like old-fashioned swashbuckling .
__label__neutral	Sometimes , that's enough .
__label__neutral	Sometimes smart but more often sophomoric .
__label__very_positive	Somewhat blurred , but Kinnear's performance is razor sharp .
__label__negative	Somewhere short of Tremors on the modern B-scene : neither as funny nor as clever , though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes .
__label__negative	Son of the Bride may be a good half-hour too long but comes replete with a flattering sense of mystery and quietness .
__label__negative	Sorry , Charlie
__label__very_negative	Soul is what's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself .
__label__positive	Sound the trumpets : For the first time since Desperately Seeking Susan , Madonna doesn't suck as an actress .
__label__neutral	Spielberg is the rare director who does not want to invite viewers to gawk at or applaud his special effects .
__label__very_negative	Splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers ' puppet strings .
__label__very_negative	Spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama .
__label__positive	Star Wars is back in a major way .
__label__negative	Stars Matthew Perry and Elizabeth Hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately Serving Sara doesn't distinguish itself from the herd .
__label__negative	Starts off with a bang , but then fizzles like a wet stick of dynamite at the very end .
__label__negative	Static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , Hey Arnold !
__label__very_positive	Stay clear of reminding yourself that it's a `` true story '' and you're likely to have one helluva time at the movies .
__label__positive	Steers turns in a snappy screenplay that curls at the edges ; it's so clever you want to hate it .
__label__positive	Stephen Earnhart's homespun documentary Mule Skinner Blues has nothing but love for its posse of trailer park denizens .
__label__positive	Steve Irwin's method is Ernest Hemmingway at accelerated speed and volume .
__label__neutral	Stevenson's performance is at once clueless and fiercely committed , a volatile combination .
__label__negative	Still , I'm not quite sure what the point is ...
__label__negative	Still , I thought it could have been more .
__label__negative	Still , it gets the job done -- a sleepy afternoon rental .
__label__negative	Still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral .
__label__positive	Still pretentious and filled with subtext , but entertaining enough at ` face value ' to recommend to anyone looking for something different .
__label__negative	Strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and B-film thuggery .
__label__positive	Sturdy , entertaining period drama ... both Caine and Fraser have their moments .
__label__positive	Subversive , meditative , clinical and poetic , The Piano Teacher is a daring work of genius .
__label__positive	Succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the Police Academy series .
__label__negative	Succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the Touched by an Angel school of non-God spiritual-uplift movies .
__label__negative	Sucking all the ` classic ' out of Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and Disney-fied adolescent angst ...
__label__very_negative	Suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video .
__label__very_negative	Suffocated at conception by its Munchausen-by-proxy mum .
__label__negative	Suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let's just say the ingredients don't quite add up to a meal .
__label__negative	Sunshine State lacks the kind of dynamic that Limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece .
__label__positive	Superior genre storytelling , which gets under our skin simply by crossing the nuclear line .
__label__neutral	Sure , it's more of the same , but as the film proves , that's not always a bad thing .
__label__negative	Sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre .
__label__very_positive	Tadpole is a sophisticated , funny and good-natured treat , slight but a pleasure .
__label__neutral	Tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films : Young is cool , and too young is too cool .
__label__positive	Tailored to entertain !
__label__positive	Take Care of My Cat offers a refreshingly different slice of Asian cinema .
__label__neutral	Take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we've seen and all you have left are John Leguizamo's cool jackets .
__label__negative	Taken individually or collectively , the stories never add up to as much as they promise .
__label__neutral	Taken purely as an exercise in style , this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore .
__label__negative	Technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial .
__label__very_positive	Tender yet lacerating and darkly funny fable .
__label__neutral	Thankfully , the film , which skirts that rapidly deteriorating line between fantasy and reality ... takes a tongue-in-cheek attitude even as it pushes the Croc Hunter agenda .
__label__neutral	That's the only sane rationale I can think of for Swimfan's existence .
__label__positive	That Zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center , no less -- indicates where his ambitions have wandered .
__label__neutral	That is essentially what's missing from Blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point .
__label__very_positive	That rara avis : the intelligent romantic comedy with actual ideas on its mind .
__label__very_positive	The 3D images only enhance the film's otherworldly quality , giving it a strange combo of you-are-there closeness with the disorienting unreality of the seemingly broken-down fourth wall of the movie screen .
__label__neutral	The AM-radio soundtrack and game cast -- Tierney and the inimitable Walken especially -- keep this unusual comedy from choking on its own conceit .
__label__positive	The Bourne Identity is what summer screen escapism used to be in the decades when it was geared more to grownups .
__label__neutral	The Gantzes ' interviews tend to let the guys off the hook .
__label__very_positive	The Hours is what movies are supposed to be ...
__label__positive	The Hours makes you examine your own life in much the same way its characters do , and the experience is profound .
__label__very_negative	The Irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted .
__label__neutral	The Marquis de Sade couldn't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be .
__label__very_negative	The Master Of Disaster - it's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy .
__label__very_positive	The Movie will reach far beyond its core demographic .
__label__positive	The New Guy does have a heart .
__label__neutral	The New Guy is one of them .
__label__positive	The Pianist is a fine valedictory work for Polanski , made richer by his own experiences , making his other movies somehow richer in the bargain .
__label__very_negative	The Piano Teacher is the sort of movie that discourages American audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film .
__label__very_positive	The Powers team has fashioned a comedy with more laughs than many , no question .
__label__very_negative	The Ring just left me cold and wet like I was out in the Seattle drizzle without rainwear .
__label__very_negative	The Sum of All Fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there's something cringe-inducing about seeing an American football stadium nuked as pop entertainment .
__label__positive	The Transporter is as lively and as fun as it is unapologetically dumb
__label__very_positive	The WWII drama is well plotted , visually striking and filled with enjoyably complex characters who are never what they first appear .
__label__very_negative	The Weight of Water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat .
__label__very_positive	The acting alone is worth the price of admission .
__label__negative	The acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with Csokas particularly unconnected .
__label__very_negative	The acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from Gilligan's Island -- and the CGI Scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year .
__label__negative	The actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus .
__label__neutral	The actors are so terrific at conveying their young angst , we do indeed feel for them .
__label__very_negative	The actors don't inhabit their roles -- they're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes .
__label__neutral	The additional storyline is interesting and entertaining , but it doesn't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story .
__label__very_negative	The angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging .
__label__positive	The animated subplot keenly depicts the inner struggles of our adolescent heroes - insecure , uncontrolled , and intense .
__label__neutral	The appearance of Treebeard and Gollum's expanded role will either have you loving what you're seeing , or rolling your eyes .
__label__neutral	The attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven .
__label__neutral	The average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small-town America .
__label__very_negative	The backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense .
__label__very_positive	The best movie of its kind since ` Brazil . '
__label__positive	The best thing the film does is to show us not only what that mind looks like , but how the creative process itself operates .
__label__negative	The best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations .
__label__negative	The best you can say about it is it's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now .
__label__neutral	The cartoon is about as true to the spirit of the Festival of Lights as Mr. Deeds was to that of Frank Capra .
__label__very_negative	The cartoon that isn't really good enough to be on afternoon TV is now a movie that isn't really good enough to be in theaters .
__label__negative	The cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big ... and the setting remains indistinct .
__label__neutral	The cast is uniformly excellent ... but the film itself is merely mildly charming .
__label__very_positive	The cast is uniformly excellent and relaxed .
__label__negative	The central story lacks punch .
__label__negative	The character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and Clayburgh doesn't always improve the over-the-top mix .
__label__negative	The charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin .
__label__very_negative	The cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama .
__label__very_positive	The comic performances are all spot on , especially Lee Ross's turn as Ken .
__label__negative	The creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts ' haunting is routine .
__label__neutral	The crime matters less than the characters , although the filmmakers supply enough complications , close calls and double-crosses to satisfy us .
__label__neutral	The cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie's power as a work of drama .
__label__very_positive	The director , Steven Shainberg , has succeeded by focusing intently on his characters , making them quirky individuals rather than figures of fun .
__label__neutral	The disarming cornball atmosphere has a way of infecting the entire crowd as the film rolls on .
__label__positive	The diversity of the artists represented , both in terms of style and ethnicity , prevents the proceedings from feeling repetitious , as does the appropriately brief 40-minute running time .
__label__very_positive	The drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes .
__label__very_negative	The editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden .
__label__neutral	The element of surprise might be the only thing Femme Fatale has going for it .
__label__neutral	The ending does leave you unfulfilled , but these are performances to enjoy in a memorable ensemble piece .
__label__very_negative	The ending is a cop-out .
__label__negative	The enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized .
__label__positive	The episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life .
__label__negative	The essential problem in Orange County is that , having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast , the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do .
__label__positive	The experience of watching blobby old-school CGI animation in this superlarge format is just surreal enough to be diverting .
__label__very_positive	The fact that The Rookie is a nearly impeccable cinematic experience -- and a wonderful all-ages triumph besides -- is a miracle akin to the story the film portrays .
__label__negative	The fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious .
__label__negative	The film's 45-minute running time stops shy of overkill , though viewers may be more exhausted than the athletes onscreen .
__label__neutral	The film's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place .
__label__negative	The film's center will not hold .
__label__very_positive	The film's greatest asset is how much it's not just another connect-the-dots , spy-on-the-run picture .
__label__neutral	The film's implicit premise is that the faith of the Tonga people is in every way inferior to that of John .
__label__positive	The film's real appeal won't be to Clooney fans or adventure buffs , but to moviegoers who enjoy thinking about compelling questions with no easy answers .
__label__positive	The film's sharp , often mischievous sense of humor will catch some off guard ...
__label__neutral	The film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other .
__label__very_positive	The film benefits greatly from a less manic tone than its predecessor , as Cho appears to have settled comfortably into her skin .
__label__very_positive	The film delivers not just the full assault of Reno's immense wit and insight , but a time travel back to what it felt like during those unforgettably uncertain days .
__label__negative	The film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes .
__label__neutral	The film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending .
__label__very_positive	The film has just enough of everything -- re-enactments , archival footage , talking-head interviews -- and the music is simply sublime .
__label__positive	The film hinges on its performances , and both leads are up to the task .
__label__very_negative	The film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously .
__label__very_positive	The film is all a little Lit Crit 101 , but it's extremely well played and often very funny .
__label__positive	The film is an enjoyable family film -- pretty much aimed at any youngster who loves horses .
__label__neutral	The film is directed by Wally Wolodarsky from a script by Joe Jarvis and Greg Coolidge .
__label__very_positive	The film is exhilarating to watch because Sandler , liberated from the constraints of formula , reveals unexpected depths as an actor .
__label__positive	The film is faithful to what one presumes are the book's twin premises -- that we become who we are on the backs of our parents , but we have no idea who they were at our age ; and that time is a fleeting and precious commodity no matter how old you are .
__label__negative	The film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low .
__label__positive	The film is just a big , gorgeous , mind-blowing , breath-taking mess .
__label__very_negative	The film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off .
__label__very_positive	The film is often filled with a sense of pure wonderment and excitement not often seen in today's cinema du sarcasm
__label__positive	The film is painfully authentic , and the performances of the young players are utterly convincing .
__label__negative	The film is really not so much bad as bland .
__label__positive	The film is surprisingly well-directed by Brett Ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act .
__label__positive	The film makes a strong case for the importance of the musicians in creating the Motown sound .
__label__very_negative	The film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in Chinese history : war , revolution , Communism , etc. .
__label__negative	The film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but wasn't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing .
__label__negative	The film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles .
__label__very_positive	The film often achieves a mesmerizing poetry .
__label__very_positive	The film overcomes the regular minefield of coming-of-age cliches with potent doses of honesty and sensitivity .
__label__neutral	The film provides some great insight into the neurotic mindset of all comics -- even those who have reached the absolute top of the game .
__label__positive	The film runs on equal parts of innocence and wisdom -- wisdom that comes with experience .
__label__very_negative	The film seems a dead weight .
__label__neutral	The film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future Quentin Tarantino picture
__label__positive	The film starts out as competent but unremarkable ... and gradually grows into something of considerable power .
__label__negative	The film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next .
__label__very_negative	The film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave .
__label__negative	The filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women .
__label__positive	The filmmakers skillfully evoke the sense of menace that nature holds for many urban dwellers .
__label__neutral	The final result makes for adequate entertainment , I suppose , but anyone who has seen Chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal .
__label__neutral	The heightened symmetry of this new\/old Cinema Paradiso makes the film a fuller experience , like an old friend haunted by the exigencies of time .
__label__negative	The humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny .
__label__negative	The ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch .
__label__negative	The impact of the Armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day .
__label__very_positive	The inherent strength of the material as well as the integrity of the filmmakers gives this coming-of-age story restraint as well as warmth .
__label__positive	The invincible Werner Herzog is alive and well and living in LA
__label__negative	The issue of faith is not explored very deeply
__label__neutral	The journey toward redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full-blown movie .
__label__negative	The kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion .
__label__neutral	The kind of nervous film that will either give you a mild headache or exhilarate you .
__label__very_positive	The kooky yet shadowy vision Clooney sustains throughout is daring , inventive and impressive .
__label__negative	The lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary .
__label__negative	The lack of pace kills it , although , in a movie about cancer , this might be apt .
__label__positive	The laser-projected paintings provide a spell-casting beauty , while Russell and Dreyfus are a romantic pairing of hearts , preciously exposed as history corners them .
__label__positive	The latest installment in the Pokemon canon , Pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the Japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where Pokemon graze in peace .
__label__very_positive	The level of maturity displayed by this 33-year-old first-time feature director is astonishing , considering her inexperience and her subject matter .
__label__positive	The long-range appeal of `` Minority Report '' should transcend any awards it bags .
__label__negative	The low-budget Full Frontal was one of the year's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and Solaris is its big-budget brother .
__label__very_negative	The makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep .
__label__negative	The more Kevin Costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like Dragonfly tossed at them .
__label__negative	The movie's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension .
__label__positive	The movie's eventual success should be credited to Dennis Quaid , in fighting trim shape as an athlete as well as an actor
__label__very_positive	The movie's quiet affirmation of neighborhood values gives it an honest , lived-in glow .
__label__positive	The movie's ripe , enrapturing beauty will tempt those willing to probe its inscrutable mysteries .
__label__neutral	The movie addresses a hungry need for PG-rated , nonthreatening family movies , but it doesn't go too much further .
__label__negative	The movie bounces all over the map .
__label__positive	The movie exists for its soccer action and its fine acting .
__label__negative	The movie feels like it's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens .
__label__negative	The movie gets muted and routine .
__label__very_positive	The movie has a soft , percolating magic , a deadpan suspense .
__label__very_positive	The movie has an avalanche of eye-popping visual effects .
__label__very_positive	The movie has lots of dancing and fabulous music .
__label__negative	The movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs .
__label__very_positive	The movie is a blast of educational energy , as bouncy animation and catchy songs escort you through the entire 85 minutes .
__label__very_negative	The movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel .
__label__very_positive	The movie is full of fine performances , led by Josef Bierbichler as Brecht and Monica Bleibtreu as Helene Weigel , his wife .
__label__neutral	The movie isn't always easy to look at .
__label__very_positive	The movie is one of the best examples of artful Large Format filmmaking you are likely to see anytime soon .
__label__neutral	The movie is saved from unbearable lightness by the simplicity of the storytelling and the authenticity of the performances .
__label__neutral	The movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students .
__label__positive	The movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll .
__label__very_negative	The movie makes absolutely no sense .
__label__negative	The movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable .
__label__positive	The movie stays afloat thanks to its hallucinatory production design .
__label__neutral	The movie sticks much closer to Hornby's drop-dead confessional tone than the film version of High Fidelity did .
__label__negative	The movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark .
__label__negative	The movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun .
__label__neutral	The new faces are interesting , but the old story isn't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted .
__label__negative	The noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in Sorority Boys , whose makers apparently believe that women's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction .
__label__very_negative	The only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll .
__label__negative	The only thing in Pauline and Paulette that you haven't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized Oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers .
__label__negative	The only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team .
__label__very_negative	The only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill Hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound .
__label__very_negative	The only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare .
__label__very_negative	The overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than , say , ten ... make that three minutes .
__label__negative	The overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there's still a real sense that the Star Trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction .
__label__neutral	The pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie's final scenes .
__label__very_positive	The passions aroused by the discord between old and new cultures are set against the strange , stark beauty of the Mideast desert , so lovingly and perceptively filmed that you can almost taste the desiccated air .
__label__very_positive	The people in Dogtown and Z-Boys are so funny , aggressive and alive , you have to watch them because you can't wait to see what they do next .
__label__positive	The perfect film for those who like sick comedies that can be snide .
__label__negative	The performances are so leaden , Michael Rymer's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud .
__label__negative	The period -- swinging London in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in Gangster No. 1 , but falls apart long before the end .
__label__negative	The picture , scored by a perversely cheerful Marcus Miller accordion\/harmonica\/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety .
__label__negative	The picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn .
__label__negative	The pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film can't help but go soft and stinky .
__label__positive	The pleasures of Super Troopers may be fleeting , but they'll register strongly with anybody who still retains a soft spot for precollegiate humor .
__label__very_negative	The plot grinds on with yawn-provoking dullness .
__label__negative	The plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before Sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset .
__label__negative	The plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television - caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy .
__label__negative	The plot is very clever , but Boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of .
__label__negative	The premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written ... in the thrall of a vicious hangover .
__label__very_negative	The premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them .
__label__negative	The premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the Clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences .
__label__very_positive	The principals in this cast are all fine , but Bishop and Stevenson are standouts .
__label__negative	The problem , it is with most of these things , is the script .
__label__negative	The problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of Schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .
__label__neutral	The problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , Mr. Desplechin is content to state it .
__label__negative	The problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there's no saving the movie .
__label__negative	The problem with this film is that it's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot .
__label__positive	The production values are up there .
__label__neutral	The reason I found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory .
__label__positive	The reason this picture works better than its predecessors is that Myers is no longer simply spoofing the mini-mod-madness of '60s spy movies .
__label__negative	The reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone .
__label__neutral	The recording session is the only part of the film that is enlightening -- and how appreciative you are of this depends on your level of fandom .
__label__neutral	The rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it's more comedy than suspense De Palma creates .
__label__positive	The result is mesmerizing -- filled with menace and squalor .
__label__negative	The result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached .
__label__very_positive	The result is something quite fresh and delightful .
__label__negative	The sad thing about Knockaround Guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is .
__label__negative	The saturation bombing of Reggio's images and Glass ' evocative music ... ultimately leaves viewers with the task of divining meaning .
__label__positive	The scope of the Silberstein family is large and we grow attached to their lives , full of strength , warmth and vitality . .
__label__negative	The screenplay sabotages the movie's strengths at almost every juncture .
__label__neutral	The seaside splendor and shallow , beautiful people are nice to look at while you wait for the story to get going .
__label__very_positive	The second chapter of the Harry Potter series is even more magical than the first and simply the best family film of the year .
__label__very_negative	The sequel has turned completely and irrevocably bizarre to the point of utter nonsense .
__label__negative	The situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels .
__label__very_positive	The smartest bonehead comedy of the summer .
__label__very_negative	The smug , oily demeanor that Donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named Pipe Dream is just repulsive .
__label__very_negative	The sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap .
__label__positive	The spark of special anime magic here is unmistakable and hard to resist .
__label__negative	The stories here suffer from the chosen format .
__label__very_negative	The story's so preposterous that I didn't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved .
__label__neutral	The story , like life , refuses to be simple , and the result is a compelling slice of awkward emotions .
__label__very_negative	The story ... is moldy and obvious .
__label__negative	The story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough .
__label__negative	The story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence .
__label__positive	The story feels more like a serious read , filled with heavy doses of always enticing Sayles dialogue .
__label__negative	The story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly - stunning insight that crime doesn't pay .
__label__neutral	The story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ?
__label__negative	The story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter Paul Pender overloads it with sugary bits of business .
__label__very_negative	The story loses its bite in a last-minute happy ending that's even less plausible than the rest of the picture .
__label__very_positive	The story may not be new , but Australian director John Polson , making his American feature debut , jazzes it up adroitly .
__label__neutral	The story wraps back around on itself in the kind of elegant symmetry that's rare in film today , but be warned : It's a slow slog to get there .
__label__negative	The streets , shot by cinematographer Michael Ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them .
__label__very_positive	The stunning , dreamlike visuals will impress even those viewers who have little patience for Euro-film pretension .
__label__very_negative	The stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002's first quarter .

__label__positive	The talents of the actors helps `` Moonlight Mile '' rise above its heart-on-its-sleeve writing .
__label__very_positive	The tenderness of the piece is still intact .

__label__negative	The timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off .
__label__very_negative	The title's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is .

__label__positive	The tone is balanced , reflective and reasonable .
__label__negative	The tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy .
__label__negative	The truth is that The Truth About Charlie gets increasingly tiresome .
__label__positive	The tug of war that ensues is as much a snapshot of modern China in microcosm as it is a crash course in movie mythology .
__label__negative	The tug-of-war at the core of Beijing Bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes .
__label__negative	The two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect .
__label__negative	The two leads chomp considerably more scenery with their acting than fire-breathing monsters barbecue with their breath ...
__label__very_negative	The unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession .
__label__very_positive	The unique tug-of-war with viewer expectations is undeniable , if not a pleasure in its own right .
__label__very_positive	The use of CGI and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick .

__label__negative	The vampire thriller Blade II starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun -- toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout .
__label__positive	The visuals alone make Metropolis worth seeing .
__label__positive	The voices are fine as well .
__label__neutral	The warm presence of Zhao Benshan makes the preposterous lying hero into something more than he reasonably should be .
__label__very_positive	The way Coppola professes his love for movies -- both colorful pop junk and the classics that unequivocally qualify as art -- is giddily entertaining .
__label__neutral	The weakest of the four Harry Potter books has been transformed into the stronger of the two films by the thinnest of margins .
__label__positive	The whole cast looks to be having so much fun with the slapstick antics and silly street patois , tossing around obscure expressions like Bellini and Mullinski , that the compact 86 minutes breezes by .
__label__negative	The whole damn thing is ripe for the Jerry Springer crowd .
__label__negative	The whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit .
__label__neutral	The worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors
__label__negative	The writers , director Wally Wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : Kappa Rho Alpha Phi .
__label__very_positive	The year's happiest surprise , a movie that deals with a real subject in an always surprising way .
__label__negative	Their film falters , however , in its adherence to the Disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that I'd hoped the movie would avoid .
__label__very_positive	Theirs is a simple and heart-warming story , full of mirth that should charm all but the most cynical .
__label__negative	Then lower them a bit more .
__label__negative	Theology aside , why put someone who ultimately doesn't learn at the center of a kids ' story ?
__label__positive	There's a disreputable air about the whole thing , and that's what makes it irresistible .
__label__neutral	There's a disturbing ` Great White Hope ' undertone to The Other Side of Heaven that subtly undermines its message of Christian love and compassion .
__label__very_positive	There's a vastness implied in Metropolis that is just breathtaking .
__label__negative	There's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent .
__label__positive	There's enough science to make it count as educational , and enough beauty to make it unforgettable .
__label__negative	There's more scatological action in 8 Crazy Nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career .
__label__negative	There's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity .
__label__very_positive	There's no denying the physically spectacular qualities of the film ... or the emotional integrity of the performances .
__label__neutral	There's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the Disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 MGM version .
__label__neutral	There's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong .
__label__negative	There's not enough to sustain the comedy .

__label__positive	There's not much more to this adaptation of the Nick Hornby novel than charm -- effortless , pleasurable , featherweight charm .
__label__negative	There's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought .
__label__negative	There's plenty of style in Guillermo Del Toro's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply can't sustain more than 90 minutes .
__label__neutral	There's something deeply creepy about Never Again , a new arrow in Schaeffer's quiver of ineptitudes .
__label__negative	There's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about .
__label__negative	There's suspension of disbelief and then there's bad screenwriting ... this film packs a wallop of the latter .
__label__negative	There are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust .
__label__positive	There are a few stabs at absurdist comedy ... but mostly the humor is of the sweet , gentle and occasionally cloying kind that has become an Iranian specialty .
__label__positive	There are as many misses as hits , but ultimately , it finds humor in the foibles of human behavior , and it's a welcome return to the roots of a genre that should depend on surprises .
__label__negative	There are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them .
__label__very_positive	There are just enough twists in the tale to make it far more satisfying than almost any horror film in recent memory .
__label__very_positive	There are moments in this account of the life of artist Frida Kahlo that are among cinema's finest this year .
__label__neutral	There aren't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of Georgian Jews in Tel Aviv .
__label__positive	There are slow and repetitive parts , but it has just enough spice to keep it interesting .
__label__positive	There are times when A Rumor of Angels plays like an extended episode of Touched by an Angel -- a little too much dancing , a few too many weeping scenes -- but I liked its heart and its spirit .
__label__negative	There are touching moments in Etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject .
__label__negative	There are weird resonances between actor and role here , and they're not exactly flattering .
__label__negative	There has been much puzzlement among critics about what the election symbolizes .
__label__positive	There is a kind of attentive concern that Hoffman brings to his characters , as if he has been giving them private lessons , and now it is time for their first public recital .
__label__very_positive	There is a refreshing absence of cynicism in Stuart Little 2 -- quite a rarity , even in the family film market .
__label__neutral	There is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt Seagal's character ... performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we're not watching a double .
__label__positive	There isn't a weak or careless performance amongst them .
__label__negative	There is no entry portal in The Rules of Attraction , and I spent most of the movie feeling depressed by the shallow , selfish , greedy characters .
__label__neutral	There is no insight into the anguish of Heidi's life -- only a depiction of pain , today's version of Greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate .
__label__very_negative	There is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false .
__label__very_negative	There is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production .
__label__neutral	There was time on that second round to see the subtleties of Ramsay's portrait of grief .
__label__very_positive	These are lives worth watching , paths worth following .

__label__very_negative	This extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long .
__label__negative	This film's relationship to actual tension is the same as what Christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation .
__label__neutral	This film , starring Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock , is your typical ` fish out of water ' story .
__label__neutral	This film is full of rabbits .
__label__negative	This film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay .
__label__very_negative	This film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience .
__label__negative	This film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions .
__label__negative	This formulaic chiller will do little to boost Stallone's career .
__label__negative	This goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
__label__neutral	This horror-comedy doesn't go for the usual obvious laughs at the expense of cheap-looking monsters -- unless you count Elvira's hooters .
__label__very_negative	This idea has lost its originality ... and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture .
__label__neutral	This ill-fitting Tuxedo is strictly off-the-rack .
__label__positive	This insightful , Oscar-nominated documentary , in which children on both sides of the ever-escalating conflict have their say away from watchful parental eyes , gives peace yet another chance .
__label__very_positive	This is Carion's debut feature but his script and direction hums with a confidence that many spend entire careers trying to reach .

__label__very_positive	This is a film well worth seeing , talking and singing heads and all .
__label__neutral	This is a good movie in spurts , but when it doesn't work , it's at important times .
__label__negative	This is a great subject for a movie , but Hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director John Woo has built his career on .

__label__negative	This is a particularly toxic little bonbon , palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few .
__label__positive	This is a raw and disturbing tale that took five years to make , and the trio's absorbing narrative is a heart-wrenching showcase indeed .

__label__very_positive	This is a very fine movie -- go see it .
__label__neutral	This is an hour and a half of daydreaming .
__label__positive	This is art paying homage to art .

__label__very_positive	This is cool , slick stuff , ready to quench the thirst of an audience that misses the summer blockbusters .
__label__very_positive	This is how you use special effects .
__label__negative	This is junk food cinema at its greasiest .
__label__very_negative	This isn't a `` Friday '' worth waiting for .
__label__positive	This isn't a narrative film -- I don't know if it's possible to make a narrative film about September 11th , though I'm sure some will try -- but it's as close as anyone has dared to come .
__label__very_negative	This isn't just the CliffsNotes version of Nicholas Nickleby , it's the CliffsNotes with pages missing .

__label__neutral	This is really just another genre picture .
__label__very_positive	This is simply the most fun you'll ever have with a documentary !
__label__positive	This is such a dazzlingly self-assured directorial debut that it's hard to know what to praise first .
__label__positive	This is such a high-energy movie where the drumming and the marching are so excellent , who cares if the story's a little weak .
__label__positive	This is the best American movie about troubled teens since 1998's Whatever .
__label__positive	This is the kind of movie that used to be right at home at the Saturday matinee , and it still is .
__label__negative	This is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another .
__label__very_positive	This is what IMAX was made for : Strap on a pair of 3-D goggles , shut out the real world , and take a vicarious voyage to the last frontier -- space .
__label__neutral	This kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch .
__label__very_negative	This limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982's Tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh .
__label__very_negative	This may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer's coming-of-age .
__label__positive	This may not have the dramatic gut-wrenching impact of other Holocaust films , but it's a compelling story , mainly because of the way it's told by the people who were there .
__label__very_negative	This miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing Flatbush machismo will get it through .
__label__neutral	This movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray .
__label__very_negative	This one's weaker than most .
__label__neutral	This one does .
__label__very_negative	This overproduced and generally disappointing effort isn't likely to rouse the Rush Hour crowd .
__label__negative	This pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film's producers would be in the clink for life .
__label__very_positive	This road movie gives you emotional whiplash , and you'll be glad you went along for the ride .
__label__positive	This romantic thriller is steeped in the atmosphere of wartime England , and ably captures the speech patterns , moral codes and ideals of the 1940s .
__label__very_negative	This self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy Stealing Harvard , but he's the most obvious one .
__label__very_negative	This series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last James Bond movie .
__label__very_negative	This time Kaufman's imagination has failed him .

__label__negative	Though Avary has done his best to make something out of Ellis ' nothing novel , in the end , his Rules is barely worth following .
__label__negative	Though Ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention .
__label__negative	Though Howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this Southern Gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter .
__label__positive	Though Mama takes a bit too long to find its rhythm and a third-act plot development is somewhat melodramatic , its ribald humor and touching nostalgia are sure to please anyone in search of a Jules and Jim for the new millennium .
__label__positive	Though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work .
__label__neutral	Though certainly original in form , Altar Boys requires a taste for Swamp Thing-type animation , doubled with a deafening score .
__label__negative	Though everything might be literate and smart , it never took off and always seemed static .
__label__neutral	Though it draws several decent laughs , it's low-cal Woody at best .

__label__very_positive	Though of particular interest to students and enthusiast of international dance and world music , the film is designed to make viewers of all ages , cultural backgrounds and rhythmic ability want to get up and dance .
__label__negative	Though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed ... that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like Mr. Schepisi's seems skimpy and unclear .
__label__positive	Though the controversial Korean filmmaker's latest effort is not for all tastes , it offers gorgeous imagery , effective performances , and an increasingly unsettling sense of foreboding .
__label__positive	Though the film's scenario is certainly not earthshaking , this depiction of fluctuating female sexuality has two winning lead performances and charm to spare .

__label__positive	Tim Story's not there yet - but ` Barbershop ' shows he's on his way .
__label__positive	Time Changer may not be the most memorable cinema session but its profound self-evaluation message about our fragile existence and the absence of spiritual guidance should at least invade an abundance of mindsets
__label__neutral	To enjoy this movie's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by Jolie and Burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending .

__label__neutral	Too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing .
__label__very_negative	Too loud , too long and too frantic by half , Die Another Day suggests that the Bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 can not fly over , tunnel under or barrel through .
__label__very_negative	Too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes .

__label__negative	Too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , Frank Novak's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless .
__label__negative	Too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century .
__label__negative	Topkapi this is not .
__label__very_negative	Trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere .
